Dr. Kirby F. *Smith, Dr.<br />\nLovejoy, and Dr. E. C. Armstrong<br />\nwill also probably be watchers. With<br />\n'such a galaxy of Hopkins men, there<br />\nshould be a fair count in the precincts to which they are assigned.<br />\nThe Professors and students may<br />\nhave some thrilling experiences, especially those in some of the South<br />\nBaltimore precincts. Dr. W. J. A.<br />\nBliss, who was a watcher in an election in 1905, had an experience<br />\nwhich he has never forgotten. He<br />\nwas on duty at Lombard and Hanover streets, in the Fourth Precinct<br />\nof the Ninth Ward(since changed),<br />\nfrom nine o'clock to one. Nothing of<br />\nimportance happened until about ten<br />\nminutes of one, when the Republican<br />\nwatcher asked Dr. Bliss to accompany a policeman, who was about<br />\nto arrest a man for illegitimate voting. Dr. Bliss was to see that the<br />\nPoliceman, who may have been, by<br />\nsome mere chance, under the influence of the organization, did not<br />\nlet the man loose as soon as they<br />\nwere around the corner from the<br />\npolls. The three men started to<br />\nthe station house, but around the<br />\ncorner on Hanover street, four men,<br />\nof the big-jaw variety, demanded<br />\nthat the prisoner be set free. The<br />\npoliceman drew his club and ordered<br />\nthe ruffians to stand off. But without a word of warning, they attacked him and bore him to the<br />\npavement.<br />\nDr. Bliss was the only man in<br />\nsight, and seeing that the officer's<br />\nsafety depended upon him, he drew<br />\ntwo of the bullies off and seized<br />\none by the throat. By this time<br />\nPeople crossing Hanover at Baltimore and German streets saw the<br />\nscuffle and ran to the struggling<br />\nheap. The four big-jaws then made<br />\ntheir escape down German street.<br />\n<br />\nEdmund B. Lowndes, A.

All the<br />\nHopkins supporters, however, will<br />\nbe gratified to see such a goodly<br />\nsprinkling of Hopkins graduates<br />\namong the list of candidates. The<br />\nUniversity has been accused of educating men \"out of the State\"\u2014that<br />\nis, not making them show any interest in the body politic of the<br />\nState, or caring about administering to the State affairs. Surely the<br />\nmen on the above list are doing their<br />\nbest to stop such an idea from getting into the minds of our representatives at Annapolis. May the<br />\nlist of Hopkins men running for<br />\noffice next year be twice as long,<br />\nand may they do their best to aid<br />\nthe interests of the University<br />\namong the law-makers.<br />\n<br />\nThe authorities in charge of<br />\nHomewood grounds of the University have been busy lately preparing<br />\nthe tract for the buildings. Most<br />\nof the work done up to the present<br />\nconsists of grading and excavating.<br />\nAt the side of the main athletic<br />\nfield, along the boulevard, near<br />\nCharles street; a fine, new practice<br />\nfield has been made. It is large and<br />\nwill be used for practice on bad<br />\ndays or on days before big games,<br />\nso that the main field can be kept<br />\nin good shape, as it is hard on the<br />\nturf to have three teams practicing<br />\nnearly all the year. It will be used<br />\nmainly by the baseball team. There<br />\nis some talk also of turfing it completely and laying out about 15 tennis courts to be used in the summer<br />\nafter the practices are over.<br />\nIf this should be done, the University will then be as properly<br />\nequipped for tennis as it is for other<br />\nsports. It should also create more<br />\ninterest in tennis, as the present<br />\ncourts are woefully inadequate to<br />\nhandle the large number of players.<br />\nIn addition to these probable<br />\ncourts, there are three sure turf<br />\nones which will be in prime condition for next year. They are also<br />\nalong the boulevard, but at the other<br />\nend, right at the entrance to Wyman Park, and alongside of the 220yard straightaway.<br />\nThe turf on<br />\nthem has been growing now for<br />\ntwo years, and has a good start.<br />\nAnother improvement which has<br />\nbeen made is the excavation of a<br />\nlarge bowl in front of the Carroll<br />\nMansion on Charles street, where<br />\nthe main entrance to the University<br />\ngrounds will be. The earth from<br />\nthis bowl has been used to fill the<br />\nathletic field, to level up a lot cif<br />\nground in the middle of the estate<br />\nand to build a number of causeways<br />\nthrough the woods.<br />\nAnother important improvement<br />\nis the big addition to the plant laboratory, which has been put up in<br />\nthe center of the tract. The laboratory and greenhouse were built<br />\nseveral years ago, but have now<br />\nbeen so much out-grown. that an<br />\naddition much larger than the original has been constructed.<br />\nThis is really the prettiest part of<br />\nthe estate, as the botanical department has made a beautiful garden<br />\nout in front of, the conservatories.<br />\nThe garden is about as large as a<br />\ncity block. In the center is a large<br />\nconcrete pool.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins had no difficulty in defeating the deaf mutes, on Saturday at Homewood, although the<br />\n'Varsity was unable to pile up as<br />\nlarge a score as was expected.<br />\nThe first score was made after<br />\nfour minutes of play. Gillet kicked<br />\nand the punt was carried back 15<br />\nyards by Moore. Hopkins lost the<br />\nball on downs. Hopkins regained<br />\npossession of the pigskin after futile attempts by the visitors to gain.<br />\nFulton tried right end for a gain<br />\nof 25 yards on a fake kick. The<br />\nball was advanced to Gallaudet's<br />\n15-yard line on the next play. Fulton kicked a goal from field, the<br />\nball going straight over the bar and<br />\nbetween the uprights.<br />\nIn the third period, with the ball<br />\nin Hopkins' possession, a forward<br />\npass from Gillet to Branham netted<br />\n15 yards, but Gillet was forced to<br />\nkick on the third down. Gallaudet<br />\nattempted an end run, but the ball<br />\nwas fumbled and recovered by Gittings. No gain was made on Gillet's attempt through center. On<br />\nGallaudet's 30-yard line, Fulton<br />\nkicked a field goal, the ball going<br />\ndirectly over the bar.<br />\nIn the fourth period, Hopkins<br />\nhad two chances to score a touchdown, one of which was successful.<br />\nGillet gained 5 yards through the<br />\ncenter, and a forward pass increased the distance by 20 yards.<br />\nWith the ball on the deaf mutes'<br />\nio-yard line, Bridgman made first<br />\ndown. Two more yards were made<br />\nthrough center, but Hopkins was<br />\nunable to break throilg-h the visitor's wall, and the ball went over<br />\non the mutes' 3-yard line. Gallaudet kicked. On the next play,<br />\nCatlin made 10 yards on an end.<br />\nrun. Fulton received a forward<br />\npass, and crossed the line with the<br />\npigskin after a run of 20 yards.<br />\n,Fulton kicked goal.

With<br />\n'such a galaxy of Hopkins men, there<br />\nshould be a fair count in the precincts to which they are assigned.<br />\nThe Professors and students may<br />\nhave some thrilling experiences, especially those in some of the South<br />\nBaltimore precincts. Dr. W. J. A.<br />\nBliss, who was a watcher in an election in 1905, had an experience<br />\nwhich he has never forgotten. He<br />\nwas on duty at Lombard and Hanover streets, in the Fourth Precinct<br />\nof the Ninth Ward(since changed),<br />\nfrom nine o'clock to one. Nothing of<br />\nimportance happened until about ten<br />\nminutes of one, when the Republican<br />\nwatcher asked Dr. Bliss to accompany a policeman, who was about<br />\nto arrest a man for illegitimate voting. Dr. Bliss was to see that the<br />\nPoliceman, who may have been, by<br />\nsome mere chance, under the influence of the organization, did not<br />\nlet the man loose as soon as they<br />\nwere around the corner from the<br />\npolls. The three men started to<br />\nthe station house, but around the<br />\ncorner on Hanover street, four men,<br />\nof the big-jaw variety, demanded<br />\nthat the prisoner be set free. The<br />\npoliceman drew his club and ordered<br />\nthe ruffians to stand off. But without a word of warning, they attacked him and bore him to the<br />\npavement.<br />\nDr. Bliss was the only man in<br />\nsight, and seeing that the officer's<br />\nsafety depended upon him, he drew<br />\ntwo of the bullies off and seized<br />\none by the throat. By this time<br />\nPeople crossing Hanover at Baltimore and German streets saw the<br />\nscuffle and ran to the struggling<br />\nheap. The four big-jaws then made<br />\ntheir escape down German street.<br /><br />\nEdmund B. Lowndes, A.

B., '95,<br />\nhas been nominated by the Republicans of Harford and Baltimore<br />\ncounties as their candidate for Associate Judge of the Third Judicial<br />\nCircuit.<br />\nIt is to be regretted that more<br />\ncollege men in Maryland do not<br />\nrun for political offices. All the<br />\nHopkins supporters, however, will<br />\nbe gratified to see such a goodly<br />\nsprinkling of Hopkins graduates<br />\namong the list of candidates. The<br />\nUniversity has been accused of educating men \"out of the State\"\u2014that<br />\nis, not making them show any interest in the body politic of the<br />\nState, or caring about administering to the State affairs. Surely the<br />\nmen on the above list are doing their<br />\nbest to stop such an idea from getting into the minds of our representatives at Annapolis. May the<br />\nlist of Hopkins men running for<br />\noffice next year be twice as long,<br />\nand may they do their best to aid<br />\nthe interests of the University<br />\namong the law-makers.<br /><br />\nThe authorities in charge of<br />\nHomewood grounds of the University have been busy lately preparing<br />\nthe tract for the buildings. Most<br />\nof the work done up to the present<br />\nconsists of grading and excavating.<br />\nAt the side of the main athletic<br />\nfield, along the boulevard, near<br />\nCharles street; a fine, new practice<br />\nfield has been made. It is large and<br />\nwill be used for practice on bad<br />\ndays or on days before big games,<br />\nso that the main field can be kept<br />\nin good shape, as it is hard on the<br />\nturf to have three teams practicing<br />\nnearly all the year. It will be used<br />\nmainly by the baseball team. There<br />\nis some talk also of turfing it completely and laying out about 15 tennis courts to be used in the summer<br />\nafter the practices are over.<br />\nIf this should be done, the University will then be as properly<br />\nequipped for tennis as it is for other<br />\nsports. It should also create more<br />\ninterest in tennis, as the present<br />\ncourts are woefully inadequate to<br />\nhandle the large number of players.<br />\nIn addition to these probable<br />\ncourts, there are three sure turf<br />\nones which will be in prime condition for next year. They are also<br />\nalong the boulevard, but at the other<br />\nend, right at the entrance to Wyman Park, and alongside of the 220yard straightaway.<br />\nThe turf on<br />\nthem has been growing now for<br />\ntwo years, and has a good start.<br />\nAnother improvement which has<br />\nbeen made is the excavation of a<br />\nlarge bowl in front of the Carroll<br />\nMansion on Charles street, where<br />\nthe main entrance to the University<br />\ngrounds will be. The earth from<br />\nthis bowl has been used to fill the<br />\nathletic field, to level up a lot cif<br />\nground in the middle of the estate<br />\nand to build a number of causeways<br />\nthrough the woods.<br />\nAnother important improvement<br />\nis the big addition to the plant laboratory, which has been put up in<br />\nthe center of the tract. The laboratory and greenhouse were built<br />\nseveral years ago, but have now<br />\nbeen so much out-grown. that an<br />\naddition much larger than the original has been constructed.<br />\nThis is really the prettiest part of<br />\nthe estate, as the botanical department has made a beautiful garden<br />\nout in front of, the conservatories.<br />\nThe garden is about as large as a<br />\ncity block. In the center is a large<br />\nconcrete pool.<br /><br />\nHopkins had no difficulty in defeating the deaf mutes, on Saturday at Homewood, although the<br />\n'Varsity was unable to pile up as<br />\nlarge a score as was expected.<br />\nThe first score was made after<br />\nfour minutes of play. Gillet kicked<br />\nand the punt was carried back 15<br />\nyards by Moore. Hopkins lost the<br />\nball on downs. Hopkins regained<br />\npossession of the pigskin after futile attempts by the visitors to gain.<br />\nFulton tried right end for a gain<br />\nof 25 yards on a fake kick. The<br />\nball was advanced to Gallaudet's<br />\n15-yard line on the next play. Fulton kicked a goal from field, the<br />\nball going straight over the bar and<br />\nbetween the uprights.<br />\nIn the third period, with the ball<br />\nin Hopkins' possession, a forward<br />\npass from Gillet to Branham netted<br />\n15 yards, but Gillet was forced to<br />\nkick on the third down. Gallaudet<br />\nattempted an end run, but the ball<br />\nwas fumbled and recovered by Gittings. No gain was made on Gillet's attempt through center. On<br />\nGallaudet's 30-yard line, Fulton<br />\nkicked a field goal, the ball going<br />\ndirectly over the bar.<br />\nIn the fourth period, Hopkins<br />\nhad two chances to score a touchdown, one of which was successful.<br />\nGillet gained 5 yards through the<br />\ncenter, and a forward pass increased the distance by 20 yards.<br />\nWith the ball on the deaf mutes'<br />\nio-yard line, Bridgman made first<br />\ndown. Two more yards were made<br />\nthrough center, but Hopkins was<br />\nunable to break throilg-h the visitor's wall, and the ball went over<br />\non the mutes' 3-yard line. Gallaudet kicked. On the next play,<br />\nCatlin made 10 yards on an end.<br />\nrun.
