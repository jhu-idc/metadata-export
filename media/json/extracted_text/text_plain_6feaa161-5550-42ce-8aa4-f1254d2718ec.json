Griffith<br />\nFeature Editor<br />\nCopy Editor<br />\nDave Kotelchuck<br />\nJohn Rothney<br />\n<br />\nSome Views On Spirit<br />\nThere was a time when Hopkins was steeped in \"good\" collegiate tradition. Freshmen were required to wear beanies,<br />\narmy ties,' black socks; and access to Gilman Hall for the Frosh<br />\nwas only through the tunnel entrance. Just as the tunnel is now<br />\nabout to fade into oblivion, these childish manifestations of<br />\nschool spirit were forgotten as the University grew from adolescence into maturity.<br />\nNo doubt there was an enthusiastic school spirit in the days<br />\nof class yells like \"... fatta, dikka, foo! Hopkins! Hopkins!<br />\nNineteen two!\"; but a return of the present Hopkins community<br />\nto the \"beanie\" method of building school spirit would, we feel,<br />\nbe contrary to what the University has come. to stand for.<br />\nThese superficial, physical displays may help to instill a<br />\nsense of belonging and pave the way for a deeper, abstract \"enthusiastic loyalty\" to the University; but they are at best only a<br />\nbeginning. The essence of the spirit at this University seems<br />\nto he based on a respect for the higher ideals toward which its<br />\nmen strive, rather than the transitory whims of immature<br />\nindividuals. Perhaps the most important factors in forming This<br />\nspirit are the Customs, the Athletic Program, and the Gentleman's Code.<br />\nOutlined,on page 109 of the Handbook are the few customs<br />\nof the University; they are simple. For example; Leaving a class<br />\nif the professor does not appear within five minutes, and rising<br />\nat any gathering when the President of the University is introduced.<br />\nAll Freshmen are introduced to learn and observe these<br />\ncustoms, yet the front door of Gilman listed in the series of<br />\ncustoms a,s reserved for seniors, is now a thruway, the Gilman<br />\nMemorial room is an extension of smoke alley, and the seal<br />\nembedded in the floor of the Gilman foyer is trod upon by professors, students and visitors alike. There are sound traditions<br />\nbehind all of these observances, they manifest a respect for the<br />\nUniversity, its first president, and its seniors\u2014failure to observe<br />\n.ms is tantamount to showing disrespect for the University.<br />\ncusto<br />\nThe athletic policy is such that a student is primarily motivated to play for the sport rather than the idolized admiration of<br />\nhis fellow students. The athlete is a student first, and as much<br />\na gentleman a-s a sportsman.<br />\nThe Honor Code is the proudest tradition we can boast;<br />\non its success hinge the very ideals of the University. If we<br />\ndo not abide by it we jeopardize our positions in a community<br />\nthat assumes us to be gentlemen and scholars, in fact we endanger the underlying spirit of an academic community.<br />\nThe text of the Gentleman's Code is included here in its<br />\nentirety because we feel that it is the embodiment of the spirit<br />\nunique at the Hopkins.<br />\n\u2022 The Johns Hopkins Honor System is the self-imposed moral code of a community of gentlemen. It<br />\nexists, in this community, to guarantee high standards<br />\nof conduct, to limit membership to persons who are able<br />\nand willing to maintain these standards.<br />\nThe Honor System governs not only conduct in<br />\nclass and examination rooms, but also those aspects<br />\nof behavior among students on the Campus, or at the<br />\nlocation of Campus-sponsored activities, which might in<br />\nany way compromise or undermine the present valued<br />\nethical concept of Hopkins men.<br />\nAn honor system is a privilege resting upon the<br />\nclearly perceived merit of its beneficiaries. They must<br />\nexercise care in order that no suspicion of evasion or<br />\nviolation fall upon them.<br />\nSince the inception of the Honor Code, all true<br />\nHopkins men have revered and respected it, considering<br />\nthemselves privileged to abide by its principles.<br />\nWe do not feel that spirit is lacking at Hopkins, we do feel<br />\nthat we have a kind of spirit that differs from the \"rah rah\" feeling so often found in contemporary American colleges. The<br />\nspirit here is what might be expected in a truly scholarly environment\u2014we are more than merely pupils, we are students, and we<br />\nare more than merely students\u2014we are gentlemen a.s well.<br />\nThose who scurry about looking for the Hopkins spirit seem to be<br />\nunable to find it because they are looking in the wrong direction.<br />\n<br />\nCampus Leaders Voice Views<br />\nWelch Lauds Beever Cites Ideals ODK Defined<br />\nSenior Class Of Gentleman'sCode By Fortunato<br />\nAs Tradition Basis<br />\n<br />\nBy BOB MYERS<br />\n\"Attendance and enthusiasm at<br />\nclass meetings was greater than<br />\nI could expect,\" said Bob Welch,<br />\n<br />\nBy MORT ALTERMAN<br />\n<br />\nBy DAVID KOTELCHUCK<br />\nFeature Editor<br />\n<br />\n\"We would be content to do<br />\nnothing if nothing needed doing,\"<br />\nThe ideal of the Honor System, said Omicron Delta Kappa presi.\u2022<br />\n<br />\nWelch, the mutual faith among University dent Angelo Fortunato of the peg'<br />\nis optimistic not only about members, forms the basis for what tion of that organization on the<br />\nsenior class participation, but also remains of Hopkins' traditions, Hopkins campus.

Griffith<br />\nFeature Editor<br />\nCopy Editor<br />\nDave Kotelchuck<br />\nJohn Rothney<br /><br />\nSome Views On Spirit<br />\nThere was a time when Hopkins was steeped in \"good\" collegiate tradition. Freshmen were required to wear beanies,<br />\narmy ties,' black socks; and access to Gilman Hall for the Frosh<br />\nwas only through the tunnel entrance. Just as the tunnel is now<br />\nabout to fade into oblivion, these childish manifestations of<br />\nschool spirit were forgotten as the University grew from adolescence into maturity.<br />\nNo doubt there was an enthusiastic school spirit in the days<br />\nof class yells like \"... fatta, dikka, foo! Hopkins! Hopkins!<br />\nNineteen two!\"; but a return of the present Hopkins community<br />\nto the \"beanie\" method of building school spirit would, we feel,<br />\nbe contrary to what the University has come. to stand for.<br />\nThese superficial, physical displays may help to instill a<br />\nsense of belonging and pave the way for a deeper, abstract \"enthusiastic loyalty\" to the University; but they are at best only a<br />\nbeginning. The essence of the spirit at this University seems<br />\nto he based on a respect for the higher ideals toward which its<br />\nmen strive, rather than the transitory whims of immature<br />\nindividuals. Perhaps the most important factors in forming This<br />\nspirit are the Customs, the Athletic Program, and the Gentleman's Code.<br />\nOutlined,on page 109 of the Handbook are the few customs<br />\nof the University; they are simple. For example; Leaving a class<br />\nif the professor does not appear within five minutes, and rising<br />\nat any gathering when the President of the University is introduced.<br />\nAll Freshmen are introduced to learn and observe these<br />\ncustoms, yet the front door of Gilman listed in the series of<br />\ncustoms a,s reserved for seniors, is now a thruway, the Gilman<br />\nMemorial room is an extension of smoke alley, and the seal<br />\nembedded in the floor of the Gilman foyer is trod upon by professors, students and visitors alike. There are sound traditions<br />\nbehind all of these observances, they manifest a respect for the<br />\nUniversity, its first president, and its seniors\u2014failure to observe<br />\n.ms is tantamount to showing disrespect for the University.<br />\ncusto<br />\nThe athletic policy is such that a student is primarily motivated to play for the sport rather than the idolized admiration of<br />\nhis fellow students. The athlete is a student first, and as much<br />\na gentleman a-s a sportsman.<br />\nThe Honor Code is the proudest tradition we can boast;<br />\non its success hinge the very ideals of the University. If we<br />\ndo not abide by it we jeopardize our positions in a community<br />\nthat assumes us to be gentlemen and scholars, in fact we endanger the underlying spirit of an academic community.<br />\nThe text of the Gentleman's Code is included here in its<br />\nentirety because we feel that it is the embodiment of the spirit<br />\nunique at the Hopkins.<br />\n\u2022 The Johns Hopkins Honor System is the self-imposed moral code of a community of gentlemen. It<br />\nexists, in this community, to guarantee high standards<br />\nof conduct, to limit membership to persons who are able<br />\nand willing to maintain these standards.<br />\nThe Honor System governs not only conduct in<br />\nclass and examination rooms, but also those aspects<br />\nof behavior among students on the Campus, or at the<br />\nlocation of Campus-sponsored activities, which might in<br />\nany way compromise or undermine the present valued<br />\nethical concept of Hopkins men.<br />\nAn honor system is a privilege resting upon the<br />\nclearly perceived merit of its beneficiaries. They must<br />\nexercise care in order that no suspicion of evasion or<br />\nviolation fall upon them.<br />\nSince the inception of the Honor Code, all true<br />\nHopkins men have revered and respected it, considering<br />\nthemselves privileged to abide by its principles.<br />\nWe do not feel that spirit is lacking at Hopkins, we do feel<br />\nthat we have a kind of spirit that differs from the \"rah rah\" feeling so often found in contemporary American colleges. The<br />\nspirit here is what might be expected in a truly scholarly environment\u2014we are more than merely pupils, we are students, and we<br />\nare more than merely students\u2014we are gentlemen a.s well.<br />\nThose who scurry about looking for the Hopkins spirit seem to be<br />\nunable to find it because they are looking in the wrong direction.<br /><br />\nCampus Leaders Voice Views<br />\nWelch Lauds Beever Cites Ideals ODK Defined<br />\nSenior Class Of Gentleman'sCode By Fortunato<br />\nAs Tradition Basis<br /><br />\nBy BOB MYERS<br />\n\"Attendance and enthusiasm at<br />\nclass meetings was greater than<br />\nI could expect,\" said Bob Welch,<br /><br />\nBy MORT ALTERMAN<br /><br />\nBy DAVID KOTELCHUCK<br />\nFeature Editor<br /><br />\n\"We would be content to do<br />\nnothing if nothing needed doing,\"<br />\nThe ideal of the Honor System, said Omicron Delta Kappa presi.\u2022<br /><br />\nWelch, the mutual faith among University dent Angelo Fortunato of the peg'<br />\nis optimistic not only about members, forms the basis for what tion of that organization on the<br />\nsenior class participation, but also remains of Hopkins' traditions, Hopkins campus.
