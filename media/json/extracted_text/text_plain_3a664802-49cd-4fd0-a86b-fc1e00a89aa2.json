Were it not for them, wellestablished<br />\nactivities<br />\ncollegiate<br />\nwould crumble into ruins and be<br />\nthings of the past. The student<br />\nbody (that is, the majority of it)<br />\nis an extremely disinterested one<br />\nas far as activities are concerned.<br />\nThis accounts for the fact that<br />\nthere is no college spirit here at<br />\nHopkins. One might say that this<br />\nthing they call \"college spirit\" is<br />\nentirely undesirable. This is a matter of opinion, and mine is that it<br />\nsincerely expresses the glories of<br />\nyouth and brings out the finest in<br />\na man's life during those four last<br />\nsweet years before branching out<br />\ninto the world of trials and tribulations.<br />\nNot only are such \"rippings\" as<br />\nthe above mentioned prominent hut<br />\nthe various groups proceed to rip<br />\ninto each other. For instance take<br />\nthe case of the controversy between<br />\nthe Black and Blue Jay and the<br />\nNEWS-LETTER. In the past issue<br />\nof the Jay, the conductors of the<br />\n\"Around the Campus\" page delighted in a typographical error and<br />\na poorly expressed passage of the<br />\npaper, and a staff candidate of the<br />\nNEWS-LETTER, in a review of the<br />\nmagazine, referred to it as being<br />\nentirely composed of mere \"high<br />\nschool wit.\"<br />\nSuch situations as these are not<br />\nuncommon. Why should we as loyal<br />\nstudents let them grow? Why<br />\nnot do away with prejudice, forget<br />\nself glory and unite in a grand<br />\neffort to BOOST HOPKNS.<br /><br />\n(Continued from page 1 Col. 4)<br /><br />\nus of any theory which could possibly explain these facts.<br /><br />\nBirely's Pharmacy<br /><br />\nThis Ad might fool you, but<br />\nthere is no deception about<br />\nthe inexpensive service of the<br /><br />\nMaster Cleaners &amp; Tailors<br />\nSuits cleaned and pressed $1.00<br />\nPressing, 35c<br />\nHats cleaned and blocked, 75c<br /><br />\nST.
