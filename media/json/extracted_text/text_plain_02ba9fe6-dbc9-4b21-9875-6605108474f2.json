Three afternoons and three<br />\nevenings a week the members of<br />\nthe cast are at work in the studio<br />\nin the Barn going through the<br />\nthree acts and putting their best<br />\nefforts into their work. A sudden<br />\nchange in the part of Sergius was<br />\nnecessary and will call for several<br />\nextra rehearsals in order to develop the understudy.<br />\nThe use of the Lyric was obtained for a rehearsal on Friday,<br />\nat which Miss Walter took the opportunity to lay special stress on<br />\nentrances and movements about<br />\nthe stage. Because of the presence of the Chicago Opera Company at the theatre just previous<br />\nto the engagement of the Dramatic Club it is impossible to<br />\nmove the scenery and props in until the morning of March 11. There<br />\nwill then be a dress rehearsal.<br />\nJoe Moran promises to be a very<br />\npleasant Riana, the heroine, and<br />\nBartus Trew as the \"chocolate<br />\ncream\" soldier will be up to his<br />\nusual standard. Henry West and<br />\nE. S. Basford, who take the other<br />\nfemale roles, are becoming almost<br />\nnatural in their parts. Stuart Mossoin is a perfect servant in a rich<br />\nhousehold, and Pierce Brawner a<br />\ntruly egotistical officer in a small<br />\nway. The costumes of each will<br />\nbe unique and pleasing to the most<br />\ncritical eye.<br />\nA word might be said about the<br />\nsets and properties. George Bernard Shaw, the author of the play,<br />\ndescribes the scenes as half rich<br />\nBulgarian, half poor Viennese.<br />\nThis brings about some strikingly<br />\namusing contrasts in furniture<br />\nand appurtenances.

The property manager is<br />\nafraid that the audience, not understanding the eccentricities of<br />\nthis Bulgarian family, will think<br />\nthat because of his inability to secure harmonious properties he has<br />\nsubstituted the first article he can<br />\nlay his hands on.

He was a member of the American swimming<br />\nteam at the Olympic games in<br />\nAntwerp in 1920, and although<br />\nnot a flashy swimmer showed rare<br />\nform and was without a doubt the<br />\nbest all-round water expert seen<br />\nhere this-season.<br />\nThe Rutgers tankers started off<br />\nby annexing the first event, the<br />\n160-yard relay. This proved to be<br />\nthe most exciting race of the evening, the first three swimmers from<br />\neach team starting off at almost<br />\nthe same moment; when Rowland<br />\ntook the water with Giebel excitement ran high, and it was not until the last few feet that Giebel<br />\npulled away and won by only a<br />\nsmall margin.<br />\nIn the fancy dive Galbraith<br />\nscored first, being most proficient<br />\nin the running and standing one<br />\nand one-half turns and the backjack.

Time and again they<br />\nstruck the allied line for gains,<br />\nwhich, if won, afforded little or no<br />\nmilitary advantage, but great glee<br />\nto the Emperor, connoisseur of art<br />\nand patron of historic cities not<br />\nhis own. As all through the war,<br />\nprocrastination and inability to<br />\nmass and economize their forces,<br />\nrendered the majority of German<br />\nefforts failures. At Antwerp the<br />\nHuns marked time before a few<br />\nregiments of Belgians, in support<br />\nof whom the weak and outnumbered Anglo-French forces were<br />\nable for a long time to hold the<br />\nScheldt River sector. The Duke<br />\nof Marlborough's Flanders plan of<br />\ncampaign, Used over two centuries<br />\nago and made so celebrated later<br />\nby Joseph Addison, was repeated<br />\nin the great conflict of Northern<br />\nFrance and Southern Belgium.<br />\nThe French successfully struck to<br />\nturn the German flank at the north<br />\ninstead of conventionally aiming<br />\nto cut their communications.<br />\nGerman success at Arras, Major<br />\nDe Bles declared, would have spelt<br />\ncomplete isolation for the British<br />\nand Belgian armies, which would<br />\nhave been cut off from the French,<br />\ndriven to the sea and so rendered<br />\nincapable of further action in the<br />\nwar. But here Hun stupidity decided for the Emperor's fad of the<br />\nspectacular\u2014the three-week battle<br />\nof Ypres ensued \u2014 goose-stepping<br />\nbattalions marched confidently under emperial eyes, to be met by<br />\nBritish steel and grit. It was a<br />\nconflict peculiarly the individual<br />\nsoldier's. Fighting day and night<br />\nfor weeks became the natural function for the mind and body to<br />\nhold out and win the universal determination and so the impossible<br />\noccurred. The armies held together<br />\nthrough the terrible days of conflict. The Germans considerately<br />\nstruck the whole line at all points<br />\nand obligingly retired everywhere.<br />\nMany times fortune looked blackest when the line was thinned some<br />\nplaces and shattered in others. But<br />\nalways British bullheadedness and<br />\nFrench spirit prevented disaster<br />\nand the gaps were speedily closed<br />\n<br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NFWS-T.FTTFP, MARCH 1, 1921<br />\nMORE PUBLICITY FOR HOPKINS<br />\n<br />\nThe establishment of a so-called<br />\n\"Speakers' Bureau,\" in connection<br />\nwith the extension work of the Y.<br />\nM. C. A., is one of the promising<br />\nachievements of our general secretary. During the past month frequent calls have come from various<br />\nchurches and young people's organizations for speakers. To meet<br />\nthis growing demand and to facilitate this phase of our religious<br />\nwork Mr. Dallas Kirwan'has been<br />\nappointed director of this bureau.<br />\nMr. Kirwan would greatly appreciate the enrollment of any and<br />\nall members of the graduate and<br />\nundergraduate student-bodies who<br />\nare willing to accept these opportunities for service.' With a large<br />\namount of foreign material of firstclass calibre and a number of enthusiastic undergraduates there is<br />\npresented the possibility of an ever<br />\nbroadening field of endeavor. Persons who know of instances where<br />\nsuch material may be used in<br />\nspeaking to clubs, missionary organization and young people's societies will find the bureau of great<br />\nhelp in securing able and earnest<br />\nspeakers.<br />\nMr. Kirwan may be<br />\nseen any day at 12.30 o'clock in<br />\nthe \"Y\" office.<br />\nwith \"rest troops\" and reserves.<br />\nThe greatest of tactical skill was<br />\nemployed at that time in moving<br />\ntroops from one sector to another,<br />\nto retire from, support and rearrange parts of the line endangered.<br />\nSo Ypres, strategically of great<br />\nimportance as a railway center to \u2022<br />\nBruges, Rouler and Merim, was<br />\nadded by the Emperor to his list oi<br />\npersonal desires. It was to be had<br />\nat all costs. The cost of failure<br />\nto obtain it was two dead divisions, formerly of the German<br />\narmies. Like Verdun, the Battle<br />\nof Ypres will forever remain for<br />\nthe allied, nations a symbol of<br />\nheroic achievement, undying devotion to duty and a determination<br />\nto stand and hold fast to those<br />\nideals and principles cherished by<br />\nthe Anglo-Saxons in all ages.<br />\nIn closing Major De Bles made<br />\nan eloquent appeal that \"above all<br />\nthe lessons learned from the war<br />\nshould not be forgotten.\" All those<br />\nmemories of the great conflict that<br />\nbring home the necessity for obedience, courage, resolution and persistence in the problems that<br />\neternally confront us should not<br />\nbe forgotten, but should be treasurd and kept alive in our thoughts<br />\nand actions. Great precaution, he<br />\nurged, should be made against the<br />\npresent undertoned German propaganda which is striving with much<br />\nsuccess to allay our suspicions,<br />\nplay upon our sympathies and generally rebuild our amicable relations\u2014all to the end, perhaps, of<br />\na future, more successful war.<br />\nSo interesting and instructive<br />\nhas the series of lectures by Major<br />\nDe Bles proved that it is highly<br />\nprobable he will supplement his<br />\npast talks in the near future with<br />\nan address on \"America's Part in<br />\nthe War.\"<br />\n<br />\nLACK OF CO-OPERATION<br />\nHOLDS BACK WORK ON<br />\nHULLABALOO<br />\nSenors Urged To Turn in Required Information At Once\u2014Snapshots Tuesday\u2014Schedule of Photos An<br />\nnounced For This Week.<br />\n<br />\nThe Hullabaloo staff is being<br />\nvery seriously hampered by the<br />\nlack of co-operation on the part of<br />\nthe student-body.

A list of half a dozen names<br />\nwas at first considered, but owing<br />\nto the ineligibility of several of<br />\nthe men and the question of a majority vote, the number nominated<br />\nwas satisfactorily cut to two\u2014<br />\nMiddleton and Landy. Middleton<br />\ncarried the office, while Landy immediately after, at the second election, became sergeant-at-arms.<br />\nAnnouncement was then made<br />\nof the death of William F.

It<br />\nis impossible to estimate the effect<br />\nof a single dormitory upon our college life, but we believe that it can<br />\nhardly be overestimated.<br />\nThe chief significance of the<br />\nbuilding, however, is the fact that<br />\nthe trustees of their own accord<br />\ncompleted the fund necessary for<br />\nits construction. This action<br />\nmeans that they have become alive<br />\nto the fact that it is the college<br />\neniiironment and life, more than<br />\nclasses alone, which educates the<br />\nstudent and prepares him to be a<br />\nleader.<br />\nA LIMITED ENROLLMENT<br />\n<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER hails with joy<br />\nPresident Goodman's announcement that he deems it necessary<br />\nto limit the enrollment under present conditions. It is true that the<br />\ngreat increase in our student body<br />\nhas almost destroyed the personal<br />\ncontact between professor and<br />\nstudent which was present in the<br />\npast. It is. equally true that the<br />\ncollege lacks the proper facilities<br />\n<br />\nto instruct adequately a larger<br />\nnumber of students.<br />\nBut the fact that the university<br />\nis unable to educate properly a<br />\nlarge number of students that it<br />\nnow has is not the only objection<br />\nto\u2022the present size of the studentbody. A number\u2014and the NEWSLETTER is proud to place itself in<br />\ntheir rank\u2014have thought for a<br />\nlong time that the great increase in<br />\nthe size of the student-body has<br />\nbeen far from beneficial to the university. The object of a university<br />\nis to train leaders, but obviously<br />\nit is unable to do this if it has not<br />\ngot the proper material to work<br />\nwith. Numbers are not a measure<br />\nof progress; quality not quanity<br />\nis desired.<br />\nDEMORALIZING EFFECT OF PRESENT SYSTEM OF EXAMINATIONS!<br />\n<br />\n. The following letter taken from<br />\nthe corespondence column of the<br />\nGoucher College Weekly states the<br />\ncase for limited exemption from<br />\nexaminations so lucidly that its<br />\nquotation ought to have some effect on our own scholastic authorities.<br />\nWith one or two minor<br />\nchanges its arguments apply directly and exceedingly forcefully<br />\nto conditions at Hopkins. For just<br />\nas at Goucher.<br />\n\"Our professors spend a good<br />\ndeal of time and a good deal of<br />\nenergy bemoaning the fact that we<br />\ndo not take our work seriously<br />\nenough; that we neglect to study<br />\nassignments from day to day and<br />\nthen sit up all night before examinations \"cramming\" the knowledge that we should have spent a<br />\nwhole semester assimilating. They<br />\nsigh for some incentive with which<br />\nto awaken our interest, or at least<br />\nour common sense\u2014and the sigh<br />\nis echoed back. It seems to me<br />\nthat the whole problem has been<br />\nmost admirably solved by the<br />\nphysics and chemistry departments. Ask the average girl to<br />\ngo to the Parkway with you any<br />\nweek night. Her reply will, in all<br />\nprobability, be something like<br />\nthis: \"Thrilled to go, Mary, dear,<br />\nif you'll just wait till I finish my<br />\nphysics. Have five classes tomorrow, but I should worry about the<br />\nrest; I can 'get by' them.\" Is it<br />\nthat she has been brought by some<br />\noccult method to see that it is<br />\nwiser to study her physics from<br />\nday to day? Far from it. The<br />\nreal truth is, she knows that by<br />\nworking every day she stands a<br />\nchance of getting out of the examination. There lies the secret<br />\nof our conscientious application to<br />\nthe sciences; there lies the solution<br />\nof their problem for our professors if they but care to take it.<br />\nExemption from exam! We will<br />\nwork from day to day; we will<br />\nstudy for quizzes; we will do our<br />\noutside reading religiously if only<br />\nthere lies before us the possibility<br />\nof that bag of gold at the foot of<br />\nthe rainbow. But, say we, what's<br />\nthe use of working all year when<br />\nyou have to take the examination<br />\nanyhow and cramming will get<br />\nyou by?<br />\nThe last sentence in particular<br />\n<br />\nstrikes us as unusually true. It<br />\nseems a strange sentiment to appear in a NEWS-LETTER editorial<br />\nsoon after mid-year; for years<br />\nfatherly advice as to the advantages of daily hard study has been<br />\nmeted out at this time. And we<br />\nstill wish to repeat our belief in<br />\nthe efficacy of close daily application as a mode of self-descipline,<br />\nas a character builder. But the<br />\nsystem of examinations at Hopkins, as elsewhere, induces not toward but away from continuous<br />\nwork. Even the unusually hard<br />\nexaminations of the recent past<br />\ndid not pick out shirkers for failures, for surely the number of<br />\nthose who passed through cram\u2022 ming was incalculably larger<br />\nthan the number which passed<br />\nthrough consistent study. When<br />\nwe think of those \"crarnmers\"<br />\nwho received higher marks than<br />\nsteady students the present system<br />\nof examinations appears absolutely demoraliizng.<br />\nWhy not make it worth while to<br />\nstudy from day to day, Mr. Professor? Why not entice the wayward student to the pleasant fields<br />\nof scholarship with the bait of<br />\nexemption from examination?<br />\nOUR EDITORIAL ON \"'DR.' LITZ.\"<br />\n<br />\nWe confess surprise concerning<br />\nthe amount of contention stirred<br />\nup by our editorial of last week on<br />\n\"'Dr.* Litz,\" and regret that it<br />\nshould have been so grievously<br />\nmisconstrued.<br />\nIn the first place it was regarded<br />\nas a personal attack by a member<br />\nof the staff on Mr. Litz. Such was<br />\nnot the case. It has always been<br />\nour policy to avoid as much as<br />\npossible the personal element in<br />\nour editorials and to reflect the<br />\nsentiment and feeling of the student body. The editorial was not<br />\nfounded on personal animosity,<br />\nbut upon the attitude of the students and opinions expressed<br />\ndowntown. If there were anything in the editorial which might<br />\nbe considered personal, we frankly<br />\napologize and beg Mr. Litz to believe that it was not our intention<br />\nthat it should be so regarded.<br />\nIt has also been intimated that<br />\nit was our intention to attack the<br />\nFaculty. We deny this accusation<br />\nheartily and confess that we see<br />\nno grounds upon which such a<br />\ncharge could be based.<br />\nOur editorial was aimed purely<br />\nat the inadvisability of publishing<br />\nsuch an article, whether it was intended to be taken seriously or<br />\nnot, in one of the city's leading<br />\nnewspapers, and we reiterate that<br />\nin our opinion it was a serious<br />\nmistake.<br />\nIn all justice to Mr. Litz the<br />\npublic should know that he aid<br />\nnot seek the nublicity thus unfortunately accorded him, that the<br />\nremarks which formed the basis<br />\nfor the original (and exceedingly<br />\nclever) article were not intended<br />\nfor publication, and appeared<br />\nwithout his knowledge or consent,<br />\nand that in this case he is the victim of the newpaper's tireless<br />\nsearch for \"copy.\"<br />\n<br />\nYe Olde Home Brewe<br />\nal<br />\n<br />\nuseasmsea1<br />\n<br />\nJunior\u2014Shall we brain him?<br />\nSoph\u2014You can't; he's a freshman.

Time and again they<br />\nstruck the allied line for gains,<br />\nwhich, if won, afforded little or no<br />\nmilitary advantage, but great glee<br />\nto the Emperor, connoisseur of art<br />\nand patron of historic cities not<br />\nhis own. As all through the war,<br />\nprocrastination and inability to<br />\nmass and economize their forces,<br />\nrendered the majority of German<br />\nefforts failures. At Antwerp the<br />\nHuns marked time before a few<br />\nregiments of Belgians, in support<br />\nof whom the weak and outnumbered Anglo-French forces were<br />\nable for a long time to hold the<br />\nScheldt River sector. The Duke<br />\nof Marlborough's Flanders plan of<br />\ncampaign, Used over two centuries<br />\nago and made so celebrated later<br />\nby Joseph Addison, was repeated<br />\nin the great conflict of Northern<br />\nFrance and Southern Belgium.<br />\nThe French successfully struck to<br />\nturn the German flank at the north<br />\ninstead of conventionally aiming<br />\nto cut their communications.<br />\nGerman success at Arras, Major<br />\nDe Bles declared, would have spelt<br />\ncomplete isolation for the British<br />\nand Belgian armies, which would<br />\nhave been cut off from the French,<br />\ndriven to the sea and so rendered<br />\nincapable of further action in the<br />\nwar. But here Hun stupidity decided for the Emperor's fad of the<br />\nspectacular\u2014the three-week battle<br />\nof Ypres ensued \u2014 goose-stepping<br />\nbattalions marched confidently under emperial eyes, to be met by<br />\nBritish steel and grit. It was a<br />\nconflict peculiarly the individual<br />\nsoldier's. Fighting day and night<br />\nfor weeks became the natural function for the mind and body to<br />\nhold out and win the universal determination and so the impossible<br />\noccurred. The armies held together<br />\nthrough the terrible days of conflict. The Germans considerately<br />\nstruck the whole line at all points<br />\nand obligingly retired everywhere.<br />\nMany times fortune looked blackest when the line was thinned some<br />\nplaces and shattered in others. But<br />\nalways British bullheadedness and<br />\nFrench spirit prevented disaster<br />\nand the gaps were speedily closed<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NFWS-T.FTTFP, MARCH 1, 1921<br />\nMORE PUBLICITY FOR HOPKINS<br /><br />\nThe establishment of a so-called<br />\n\"Speakers' Bureau,\" in connection<br />\nwith the extension work of the Y.<br />\nM. C. A., is one of the promising<br />\nachievements of our general secretary. During the past month frequent calls have come from various<br />\nchurches and young people's organizations for speakers. To meet<br />\nthis growing demand and to facilitate this phase of our religious<br />\nwork Mr. Dallas Kirwan'has been<br />\nappointed director of this bureau.<br />\nMr. Kirwan would greatly appreciate the enrollment of any and<br />\nall members of the graduate and<br />\nundergraduate student-bodies who<br />\nare willing to accept these opportunities for service.' With a large<br />\namount of foreign material of firstclass calibre and a number of enthusiastic undergraduates there is<br />\npresented the possibility of an ever<br />\nbroadening field of endeavor. Persons who know of instances where<br />\nsuch material may be used in<br />\nspeaking to clubs, missionary organization and young people's societies will find the bureau of great<br />\nhelp in securing able and earnest<br />\nspeakers.<br />\nMr. Kirwan may be<br />\nseen any day at 12.30 o'clock in<br />\nthe \"Y\" office.<br />\nwith \"rest troops\" and reserves.<br />\nThe greatest of tactical skill was<br />\nemployed at that time in moving<br />\ntroops from one sector to another,<br />\nto retire from, support and rearrange parts of the line endangered.<br />\nSo Ypres, strategically of great<br />\nimportance as a railway center to \u2022<br />\nBruges, Rouler and Merim, was<br />\nadded by the Emperor to his list oi<br />\npersonal desires. It was to be had<br />\nat all costs. The cost of failure<br />\nto obtain it was two dead divisions, formerly of the German<br />\narmies. Like Verdun, the Battle<br />\nof Ypres will forever remain for<br />\nthe allied, nations a symbol of<br />\nheroic achievement, undying devotion to duty and a determination<br />\nto stand and hold fast to those<br />\nideals and principles cherished by<br />\nthe Anglo-Saxons in all ages.<br />\nIn closing Major De Bles made<br />\nan eloquent appeal that \"above all<br />\nthe lessons learned from the war<br />\nshould not be forgotten.\" All those<br />\nmemories of the great conflict that<br />\nbring home the necessity for obedience, courage, resolution and persistence in the problems that<br />\neternally confront us should not<br />\nbe forgotten, but should be treasurd and kept alive in our thoughts<br />\nand actions.

It<br />\nis impossible to estimate the effect<br />\nof a single dormitory upon our college life, but we believe that it can<br />\nhardly be overestimated.<br />\nThe chief significance of the<br />\nbuilding, however, is the fact that<br />\nthe trustees of their own accord<br />\ncompleted the fund necessary for<br />\nits construction. This action<br />\nmeans that they have become alive<br />\nto the fact that it is the college<br />\neniiironment and life, more than<br />\nclasses alone, which educates the<br />\nstudent and prepares him to be a<br />\nleader.<br />\nA LIMITED ENROLLMENT<br /><br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER hails with joy<br />\nPresident Goodman's announcement that he deems it necessary<br />\nto limit the enrollment under present conditions. It is true that the<br />\ngreat increase in our student body<br />\nhas almost destroyed the personal<br />\ncontact between professor and<br />\nstudent which was present in the<br />\npast. It is. equally true that the<br />\ncollege lacks the proper facilities<br /><br />\nto instruct adequately a larger<br />\nnumber of students.<br />\nBut the fact that the university<br />\nis unable to educate properly a<br />\nlarge number of students that it<br />\nnow has is not the only objection<br />\nto\u2022the present size of the studentbody. A number\u2014and the NEWSLETTER is proud to place itself in<br />\ntheir rank\u2014have thought for a<br />\nlong time that the great increase in<br />\nthe size of the student-body has<br />\nbeen far from beneficial to the university. The object of a university<br />\nis to train leaders, but obviously<br />\nit is unable to do this if it has not<br />\ngot the proper material to work<br />\nwith. Numbers are not a measure<br />\nof progress; quality not quanity<br />\nis desired.<br />\nDEMORALIZING EFFECT OF PRESENT SYSTEM OF EXAMINATIONS!<br /><br />\n. The following letter taken from<br />\nthe corespondence column of the<br />\nGoucher College Weekly states the<br />\ncase for limited exemption from<br />\nexaminations so lucidly that its<br />\nquotation ought to have some effect on our own scholastic authorities.<br />\nWith one or two minor<br />\nchanges its arguments apply directly and exceedingly forcefully<br />\nto conditions at Hopkins. For just<br />\nas at Goucher.<br />\n\"Our professors spend a good<br />\ndeal of time and a good deal of<br />\nenergy bemoaning the fact that we<br />\ndo not take our work seriously<br />\nenough; that we neglect to study<br />\nassignments from day to day and<br />\nthen sit up all night before examinations \"cramming\" the knowledge that we should have spent a<br />\nwhole semester assimilating. They<br />\nsigh for some incentive with which<br />\nto awaken our interest, or at least<br />\nour common sense\u2014and the sigh<br />\nis echoed back. It seems to me<br />\nthat the whole problem has been<br />\nmost admirably solved by the<br />\nphysics and chemistry departments. Ask the average girl to<br />\ngo to the Parkway with you any<br />\nweek night. Her reply will, in all<br />\nprobability, be something like<br />\nthis: \"Thrilled to go, Mary, dear,<br />\nif you'll just wait till I finish my<br />\nphysics. Have five classes tomorrow, but I should worry about the<br />\nrest; I can 'get by' them.\" Is it<br />\nthat she has been brought by some<br />\noccult method to see that it is<br />\nwiser to study her physics from<br />\nday to day? Far from it. The<br />\nreal truth is, she knows that by<br />\nworking every day she stands a<br />\nchance of getting out of the examination. There lies the secret<br />\nof our conscientious application to<br />\nthe sciences; there lies the solution<br />\nof their problem for our professors if they but care to take it.<br />\nExemption from exam! We will<br />\nwork from day to day; we will<br />\nstudy for quizzes; we will do our<br />\noutside reading religiously if only<br />\nthere lies before us the possibility<br />\nof that bag of gold at the foot of<br />\nthe rainbow. But, say we, what's<br />\nthe use of working all year when<br />\nyou have to take the examination<br />\nanyhow and cramming will get<br />\nyou by?<br />\nThe last sentence in particular<br /><br />\nstrikes us as unusually true. It<br />\nseems a strange sentiment to appear in a NEWS-LETTER editorial<br />\nsoon after mid-year; for years<br />\nfatherly advice as to the advantages of daily hard study has been<br />\nmeted out at this time. And we<br />\nstill wish to repeat our belief in<br />\nthe efficacy of close daily application as a mode of self-descipline,<br />\nas a character builder. But the<br />\nsystem of examinations at Hopkins, as elsewhere, induces not toward but away from continuous<br />\nwork. Even the unusually hard<br />\nexaminations of the recent past<br />\ndid not pick out shirkers for failures, for surely the number of<br />\nthose who passed through cram\u2022 ming was incalculably larger<br />\nthan the number which passed<br />\nthrough consistent study. When<br />\nwe think of those \"crarnmers\"<br />\nwho received higher marks than<br />\nsteady students the present system<br />\nof examinations appears absolutely demoraliizng.<br />\nWhy not make it worth while to<br />\nstudy from day to day, Mr. Professor? Why not entice the wayward student to the pleasant fields<br />\nof scholarship with the bait of<br />\nexemption from examination?<br />\nOUR EDITORIAL ON \"'DR.' LITZ.\"<br /><br />\nWe confess surprise concerning<br />\nthe amount of contention stirred<br />\nup by our editorial of last week on<br />\n\"'Dr.* Litz,\" and regret that it<br />\nshould have been so grievously<br />\nmisconstrued.<br />\nIn the first place it was regarded<br />\nas a personal attack by a member<br />\nof the staff on Mr. Litz. Such was<br />\nnot the case. It has always been<br />\nour policy to avoid as much as<br />\npossible the personal element in<br />\nour editorials and to reflect the<br />\nsentiment and feeling of the student body. The editorial was not<br />\nfounded on personal animosity,<br />\nbut upon the attitude of the students and opinions expressed<br />\ndowntown. If there were anything in the editorial which might<br />\nbe considered personal, we frankly<br />\napologize and beg Mr. Litz to believe that it was not our intention<br />\nthat it should be so regarded.<br />\nIt has also been intimated that<br />\nit was our intention to attack the<br />\nFaculty. We deny this accusation<br />\nheartily and confess that we see<br />\nno grounds upon which such a<br />\ncharge could be based.<br />\nOur editorial was aimed purely<br />\nat the inadvisability of publishing<br />\nsuch an article, whether it was intended to be taken seriously or<br />\nnot, in one of the city's leading<br />\nnewspapers, and we reiterate that<br />\nin our opinion it was a serious<br />\nmistake.<br />\nIn all justice to Mr. Litz the<br />\npublic should know that he aid<br />\nnot seek the nublicity thus unfortunately accorded him, that the<br />\nremarks which formed the basis<br />\nfor the original (and exceedingly<br />\nclever) article were not intended<br />\nfor publication, and appeared<br />\nwithout his knowledge or consent,<br />\nand that in this case he is the victim of the newpaper's tireless<br />\nsearch for \"copy.\"<br /><br />\nYe Olde Home Brewe<br />\nal<br /><br />\nuseasmsea1<br /><br />\nJunior\u2014Shall we brain him?<br />\nSoph\u2014You can't; he's a freshman.
