They have done<br />\nso in the past and will, undoubtedly, continue to do so. It must be<br />\nremembered, however, that they<br />\nusually advocate their alma mater<br />\nbecause of her reputation in the<br />\nfields in which they are particularly<br />\ninterested. Now it is obvious that<br />\nHopkins has no professors at other<br />\ncolleges who are graduates from<br />\nher technical school, as the technical course is offered for the first<br />\n.time this year. The Hopkins alumni teaching at other institutions are<br />\nprobably greatly pleased over the<br />\nestablishment of the department of<br />\ntechnology. Many of them have<br />\nprobably mentioned the department to their students, but it is<br />\nquite certain that they are not working as hard for the technical school<br />\nas the Hopkins technical school<br />\ngraduates will be working for it<br />\ntwenty or thirty years hence.<br />\nTo offset his handicap, every<br />\navailable means should be used to<br />\nkeep this new department before<br />\nthe public in the press of the country. Periodic bulletins about the<br />\nprogress to date in securing members of the faculty for the department of technology could be supplied both to the log papers and<br />\n<br />\nto the press of the nation.

Burgan and published in<br />\nthis issue of THE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nMr. Burgan has opened up the way<br />\nto supply a long-felt want of the<br />\nstudent body; namely, some adequate method of securing athletic<br />\nsupplies at the low rates which can<br />\nonly be obtained when large purchases are made. During the University year quite a sum of money<br />\nis spent by the students for athletic<br />\nsupplies. Heretofore, this money<br />\nhas been spent at random in making small, individual purchases. No<br />\nmethod was open to the students<br />\nby which they could work together<br />\nin the matter of purchasing supplies<br />\nfor the mutual benefit of all concerned.<br />\nSince his election as graduate<br />\nmanager, Mr. Burgan has accomplished much in the way of systematizing the purchases of the athletic supplies for the various teams<br />\nand has saved quite a considerable<br />\namount of money to the Athletic<br />\nAssociation. His new proposal of<br />\nco-operative buying not only benefits the students, but will also benefit the Athletic Association by enabling Mr. Burgan to secure still<br />\nlower rates as a result of the increased amount of goods that will<br />\nbe thus purchased. The students<br />\nshould avail themselves of the opportunity now afforded them and<br />\ngive the co-operative buying plan<br />\ntheir hearty support.<br />\n<br />\nfOWNES<br />\nGLOVE<br />\n<br />\n:$7.\u2018 \u2022<br />\n<br />\np,...4.::4<br />\n<br />\nClothing that Can Look You Squarely in the Face<br />\nSee<br />\n<br />\nyour eye on the Hamburger Clothing!<br />\nKEEP<br />\nhow well it wears,\u2014 the stuff, the shape, the fit.\u2014<br />\nof good taste and skillful<br />\n<br />\nEvery garment is a model<br />\ntailoring.\u2014 We are everlastingly planning to produce<br />\nclothing for those who take a pride in being well-dressed.<br />\nOur clothing is \"totally different\" from the ordinary run<br />\nof ready-made clothing. \u2014 The difference cannot be<br />\nmeasured by dollars.<br />\n<br />\nY.M.

Twenty-five men went<br />\nfrom Hopkins and about the same<br />\nnumber of girls from Goucher.<br />\nThe object of the convention is<br />\nnot only to bring before the students the need of workers and the<br />\ngreat opportunity for service<br />\nabroad, but also to discuss the<br />\nmeans of arousing a greater interest<br />\nin missions among the students of<br />\nour Maryland colleges. It brings<br />\nthe workers from the various col- .<br />\nleges into closer touch and thus<br />\n<br />\nBaltimore, Md.<br />\nbroadens the outlook of each one.<br />\nReports are made and plans for the<br />\nensuing year discussed.<br />\nIt is hoped that this year Hopkins may be able to have as many<br />\ndelegates as before. All who desire to know more about the conference can see either Alec Barton,<br />\n'14, Bud Wagner, '12, or any of<br />\nthe men who went to Westminister<br />\nlast year. They will tell you that<br />\nit not only gives one the great time<br />\nthat necessarily conies when a large<br />\nbody of students get together, but<br />\nthat it is a time when one's horizon in broadened and one is made<br />\nto see beyond his own college walls.<br />\nAs the number of delegates will be<br />\nlimited it is best to see about this<br />\nat once.<br />\n\"Do you think a woman should<br />\nget the wages of a man?\"<br />\n\"It depends on whether she is<br />\nmarried to him or not.\"-Princeton<br />\nTiger.<br />\n<br />\n\f7<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER, JANUARY 13, 1913.<br />\n<br />\nFOOTBALL BLOWOUT IN GYM<br />\nAbout One Hundred Present, and Affair<br />\nVoted Huge Success\u2014 Mr. B. Howell<br />\nGriswold the Principal Speaker.<br />\n<br />\nThe usual football blowout and<br />\nJollification meeting was held in the<br />\ngymnasium last Thursday evening.<br />\nAlmost one hundred members of the<br />\nUniversity were present. \"Freddie\"<br />\nLee was chairman of the meeting<br />\nand called for speeches from the<br />\nvarious captains. Captain Huck of<br />\nthe lacrosse team evidently believed<br />\nthat \"brevity is the soul of wit,\"<br />\n..and so showed his wit by being<br />\nbrief. Captain Pieper prophesied<br />\na \u2022successful baseball season and<br />\nurged undergraduates in particular<br />\nto come out for the team. As an<br />\ninducement he read the attractive<br />\nschedule Manager Getz has prepared. Captain Leibensperger of<br />\nthe football team next delivered an<br />\noration upon the \"queer\" season<br />\nthat we have just completed and<br />\noffered hopes of brighter things<br />\nto come. Catlin spoke for the<br />\ntrack team, promising events with<br />\nCarlisle, Virginia, Pennsylvania,<br />\nGeorgetown and Franklin and Marshall. Mr. B. Howell Griswold,<br />\nJr., was the principal speaker. He<br />\nurged the athletes to practice \"optimism\" and not get discouraged because of defeat and try to make a<br />\nweaker schedule. \"Nothing,\" he<br />\nhe said, \"is too good for Johns<br />\nHopkins.\"<br />\nThen came the awarding of honors. Dr. Abercrombie awarded<br />\nmedals to the members of the winning gymnasium team of the 1915<br />\n_Class. Hutzler receiv'ed a cup for<br />\nfirst place and Swartz a medal for<br />\nsecond. Dr. Magoffin next awarded the \"H,\" the \"H. A. A.\" and<br />\nthe \"H. M\" to the deserving members of the football team. At the<br />\nsame time they were given their<br />\nsweaters. Those, too, who had not<br />\nreceived their sweaters or letters<br />\nfor last spring's lacrosse, baseball<br />\nand track work were rewarded<br />\nthen.<br />\nSeveral short speeches were made<br />\nby \"Pete\" Porter, Tappan, Hulburt<br />\nand Burgan. At intervals the assembled crowd was convulsed with<br />\nlaughter by the antics of the \"Ragamuffin Trio.\" Their program consisted of choice selections from the<br />\noperas, impromptus and fancy buck<br />\ndancing. They put everyone into<br />\ngood spirits and made them ready<br />\nto enjoy to the full the bounteous<br />\nsupply of \"eats\" the committe'e had<br />\nprovided.

They have done<br />\nso in the past and will, undoubtedly, continue to do so. It must be<br />\nremembered, however, that they<br />\nusually advocate their alma mater<br />\nbecause of her reputation in the<br />\nfields in which they are particularly<br />\ninterested. Now it is obvious that<br />\nHopkins has no professors at other<br />\ncolleges who are graduates from<br />\nher technical school, as the technical course is offered for the first<br />\n.time this year. The Hopkins alumni teaching at other institutions are<br />\nprobably greatly pleased over the<br />\nestablishment of the department of<br />\ntechnology. Many of them have<br />\nprobably mentioned the department to their students, but it is<br />\nquite certain that they are not working as hard for the technical school<br />\nas the Hopkins technical school<br />\ngraduates will be working for it<br />\ntwenty or thirty years hence.<br />\nTo offset his handicap, every<br />\navailable means should be used to<br />\nkeep this new department before<br />\nthe public in the press of the country. Periodic bulletins about the<br />\nprogress to date in securing members of the faculty for the department of technology could be supplied both to the log papers and<br /><br />\nto the press of the nation. Announcements could be made on various points pertaining to the technical school as soon as definite deci- \"READY TO WEAR\" CLOTHES FOR YOUNG MEN<br />\nsions are reached.

Burgan and published in<br />\nthis issue of THE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nMr. Burgan has opened up the way<br />\nto supply a long-felt want of the<br />\nstudent body; namely, some adequate method of securing athletic<br />\nsupplies at the low rates which can<br />\nonly be obtained when large purchases are made. During the University year quite a sum of money<br />\nis spent by the students for athletic<br />\nsupplies. Heretofore, this money<br />\nhas been spent at random in making small, individual purchases. No<br />\nmethod was open to the students<br />\nby which they could work together<br />\nin the matter of purchasing supplies<br />\nfor the mutual benefit of all concerned.<br />\nSince his election as graduate<br />\nmanager, Mr. Burgan has accomplished much in the way of systematizing the purchases of the athletic supplies for the various teams<br />\nand has saved quite a considerable<br />\namount of money to the Athletic<br />\nAssociation. His new proposal of<br />\nco-operative buying not only benefits the students, but will also benefit the Athletic Association by enabling Mr. Burgan to secure still<br />\nlower rates as a result of the increased amount of goods that will<br />\nbe thus purchased. The students<br />\nshould avail themselves of the opportunity now afforded them and<br />\ngive the co-operative buying plan<br />\ntheir hearty support.<br /><br />\nfOWNES<br />\nGLOVE<br /><br />\n:$7.\u2018 \u2022<br /><br />\np,...4.::4<br /><br />\nClothing that Can Look You Squarely in the Face<br />\nSee<br /><br />\nyour eye on the Hamburger Clothing!<br />\nKEEP<br />\nhow well it wears,\u2014 the stuff, the shape, the fit.\u2014<br />\nof good taste and skillful<br /><br />\nEvery garment is a model<br />\ntailoring.\u2014 We are everlastingly planning to produce<br />\nclothing for those who take a pride in being well-dressed.<br />\nOur clothing is \"totally different\" from the ordinary run<br />\nof ready-made clothing. \u2014 The difference cannot be<br />\nmeasured by dollars.<br /><br />\nY.M.

Twenty-five men went<br />\nfrom Hopkins and about the same<br />\nnumber of girls from Goucher.<br />\nThe object of the convention is<br />\nnot only to bring before the students the need of workers and the<br />\ngreat opportunity for service<br />\nabroad, but also to discuss the<br />\nmeans of arousing a greater interest<br />\nin missions among the students of<br />\nour Maryland colleges.

Captain Huck of<br />\nthe lacrosse team evidently believed<br />\nthat \"brevity is the soul of wit,\"<br />\n..and so showed his wit by being<br />\nbrief.

At intervals the assembled crowd was convulsed with<br />\nlaughter by the antics of the \"Ragamuffin Trio.\" Their program consisted of choice selections from the<br />\noperas, impromptus and fancy buck<br />\ndancing.
