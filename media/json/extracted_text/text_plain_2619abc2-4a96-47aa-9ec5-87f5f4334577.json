A committee which met two weeks ago reported that<br />\nsufficient funds were obtained, and the attendance at<br />\nthe meeting indicated at least a starting enthusiasm for<br />\nthe program, yet the summer school idea was indefinitely postponed for lack of a leader.<br />\nThis excuse is not satisfactory. There must be any<br />\nnumber of Hopkins personnel who would jump at an<br />\nopportunity to kick off such a program. Victor Dates,<br />\nthe new Negro appointee would appear to be an ideal<br />\nperson for the position.<br />\nBy this suspension of activity for the summer<br />\nschool program, we do not question the integrity of<br />\nthose involved. But if advances are to be made toward<br />\nconstructive community action, let them not be idle<br />\nadvances, but rather advances accompanied by enthusiasm and good intentions.<br />\n<br />\nGrad Bag<br />\nThe founders of the graduate club deserve to<br />\nbe commended. They expended effort on a project that<br />\nmost graduate students would hardly disdain to cooperate with.<br />\nSo why object to a few eager beavers who have<br />\ntaken a -super-genuine interest in this dub project,<br />\nwhose eagerness has resulted in some trivial usurpations of power? They have after all obtained this power<br />\nby default.<br />\nThe answer is obvious. While the graduate students<br />\nhave always effected a calculated unconcern toward school<br />\nfunctions, have purposely limited their environment by<br />\ntheir discipline, are unwilling to give themselves away<br />\nby displaying corporate enthusiasm, and consequently<br />\nhave hardly a leg to stand on for asserting a justifiable<br />\noffensive against these righteous and self-styled potentates, they still must obey their convictions. And an issue<br />\nhas arisen lately which has rightly offended many of<br />\nthe graduate students. A graduate executive body has<br />\nbeen formed which pretends to speak for the students<br />\nwithout their legitimate consent, and which insists on<br />\ndeliberating on matters far beyond what is generally<br />\nagreed to be within their legitimate concern.<br />\nThe cartoon on page five has expressed this discontent most expertly. Leave well enough alone, may<br />\nwe advise; by pretending to represent the graduate<br />\nstudents on any other than social issues not only misrepresents the students, but also misrepresents the truth<br />\nthat such a body is a useful addition to the university.<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nCommittee Runs Riot<br />\n<br />\nBusiness Managers<br />\nWilliam Schenck<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, FEBRUARY 25, 1966<br />\n<br />\nBy HENRY J. KORN<br />\nWith the advent of warm<br />\nweather the time has come to<br />\nreport to the student body on<br />\nplans for the 1966 Spring Riot.<br />\nIn years past riots have failed<br />\nfor a number of reasons but a<br />\nclear over-all cause in each case<br />\nhas been a simple lack of careful planning. To correct the situation selected student leaders<br />\nwere chosen in the Fall of 1965<br />\nto serve on the Undergraduate<br />\nRiot Committee.<br />\nIgnoring the all too clear lessons inherent in the failure of<br />\nthe Intermok Rally in the Spring<br />\nof 1965 the committee spent<br />\nmost of its initial sessions conducting a detailed analysis of<br />\nthe collapse of the last nearriot in the Spring of 1964. At<br />\nthat time a misplaced waterbomb fell from the window of a<br />\nFreshman Dorm House onto the<br />\nhead of a lower echalon member<br />\nof the administration. Any question of intent or any second<br />\nthoughts of the aim on the part<br />\nof the bomb thrower were upon<br />\nthe point of burst, academic. In<br />\nany case the quadrangle soon filled with a mass of Freshmen all<br />\nwondering what they would do<br />\n<br />\nnext.<br />\n<br />\nAd Hock<br />\n<br />\nAt last the mood of the mob<br />\nturned ugly and a courageous<br />\nmember of the class screamed<br />\n\"Everybody<br />\nout<br />\nto<br />\nCharles<br />\nStreet!\" At that moment the<br />\ndorm masters intervened forming a cordon across the parking<br />\nlot. A dorm master countered<br />\n<br />\nwith \"anyone has crosses into<br />\nthe street will get, his name turned in to the Dean.\" The crowd<br />\ntook the threat to heart and<br />\nwent back to the snack bar to<br />\nwatch television. The Committee<br />\nrealized that if someone had been<br />\non hand to handle the challenge<br />\nby slugging the nearest dormnaster the rest could have proeeeded to Charles Street where<br />\nthe opportunities for destruction, and violence are everywhere.<br />\nThus in the 1966 riot the<br />\ncommittee will have strategically placed a group of foul-mouthed louts recruited from the area<br />\nto insure a minimum of success. The date for the Spring<br />\nRiot has been tentively set for<br />\nWednesday, March 16th. Although the committee has been<br />\nworking hard _ to make this<br />\nyear's riot the most destructive<br />\nand anti-social in Hopkins Hisstory there is much work yet to<br />\nbe done. The support of everyone is required for any real<br />\nsenseless brutality to take place.<br />\nAll suggestions should be placed<br />\nin a plain brown wrapper and<br />\naddressed to the Committee in<br />\ncare of the Office of Special<br />\nEvents.<br />\n<br />\nKeystone Keggery<br />\n<br />\nBy HENRY M. HOCHERMAN<br />\nIt has often been said that the<br />\ncity of Baltimore, culture center<br />\nof the great Southeast, lacks an<br />\nadequate repertory troupe, a<br />\ngroup of roving players and jesters to provide inexpensive entertainment for the masses. In<br />\ntruth, however, such a group<br />\nhas long existed and continues<br />\nto exist. Its stage Is built from<br />\nthe myriad streets of Baltimore,<br />\nand its only ceiling is the sky.<br />\nThey are dramatic, they are<br />\nnumerous, but most of all they<br />\nare comical. They dress in suits<br />\nof blue, and call themselves the<br />\nBaltimore City Police.<br />\n<br />\nbut most of all they are inept.<br />\nThey are out to stem the tide<br />\nof lawlessness which threatens<br />\nour fair city. Where are they to<br />\nbe found? Are they surrounding<br />\nthe Burlesque houses on Baltimore Street? Are they raiding<br />\ngamblers, shutting down illicit<br />\nlotteries? Are they arresting the<br />\nstreet walkers on Greenmount<br />\nAvenue? Are they cornering the<br />\nholders of overdue library books?<br />\nWrong! They are out for bigger<br />\ngame.<br />\nThey seek the evil ruffians who<br />\nendanger the Monumental City.<br />\nA street corner gang perhaps?<br />\nWrong again! The Baltimore Police, fearless, mindless, are attacking those seething hotbeds of<br />\npinko insurrestion, those monuments to sin, the Hopkins fraternities. And why not, there is no<br />\nother evil in Baltimore with<br />\nwhich they can occupy themselves. Everything else has been<br />\ncleaned up.<br />\n<br />\nTransport yourself now to the<br />\nfateful night of February 18,<br />\n1966. Danger stalks the Baltimore night. The placid skyline<br />\nweeps as evil rears its ugly head.<br />\nMinors are corrupted, and honest Southern virgins are threatened. The police, always quick,<br />\nalways ready, those stalwart defenders of justice who always<br />\nget their man, are out en Masse.<br />\nFriday night's performance<br />\nThey are fearless, they are true, causes this reporter to wonder<br />\n111111111110<br />\n,<br />\nIP+<br />\n<br />\neaued.panciefrtee\u2014<br />\nTO The Editor:<br />\nMost graduate students have<br />\nassumed the functions of the<br />\nGraduate Club to be social and<br />\nathletic. These functions have<br />\nbeen performed well by the present Executive Committee, juvenile in tone as it appears. The<br />\nthe<br />\nAdministration<br />\naccepts<br />\ngroup as representative of the<br />\ngraduate student body.<br />\nThe effort expended by the<br />\ncurrent Executive Committee in<br />\ncreation of a graduate organization cannot be discounted. Many<br />\nof their ideas and actions, especially in the area of recreation,<br />\nare valuable and have filled a<br />\ndefinite need on the Hopkins<br />\ncampus. Their entry into things<br />\npolitical should be strongly disgiven<br />\ncouraged, however. A<br />\ngraduate student who has an interest in any issue can find or<br />\nform a group to investigate this<br />\nissue.<br />\nSuch groups need not be representative of any body of people except their participating<br />\nmembers. People uninterested in<br />\n<br />\nthe topic will not participate.<br />\nThe Graduate Club is not confronting any political or intellectual vacuum on this campus.<br />\nThat individual graduate students do have specific commitments to given issues necessarily<br />\nImplies that any choice by the<br />\nExecutive Committee of a topic<br />\nwould be a gross distoration of<br />\nthe interests of the members.<br />\nThe effectiveness, and the responsibility, too, of the Executive Committee remains in those<br />\nareas where their actions can<br />\nbe representative of their members. Graduate students who enjoy the club room, the folk sings,<br />\nthe parties, should cooperate in<br />\nthe work required for these activities to function well. Attempts by the Executive Committee to broaden the range of<br />\nactivities is, in addition to having no democratic basis, completely unrealistic.<br />\nHilda Wing<br />\nDept. of Psychology<br />\n(Continued<br />\n<br />\non Page 6)<br />\n<br />\nIf there are not better things<br />\nwith which the Baltimore Police<br />\ncan occupy itself than the rush<br />\nprocedures of the only real university in Baltimore City. It<br />\nseems that there are sufficient<br />\nthugs running rampant, sufficient<br />\nvice, sufficient corruption in the<br />\nstreets of Baltimore to occupy a<br />\nthousand policemen for a thousand years. When fraternity<br />\nhouses are ransacked and vandalized during the summer the<br />\npolice are silent; when they have<br />\na rush party, all hell breaks<br />\nloose. But there Is a crackdown<br />\non. A reformation, and the fraternities, It seems, are especially<br />\nvulnerable.<br />\nThe problem here is more<br />\nthan just an arbitrary police decision to enforce the anti-alcohol<br />\nstatutes, or the acts of forceful<br />\nentry perpetrated by policemen<br />\non an arbitrarily chosen fraternity house. The problem is distrust in the community of the<br />\nstudent.<br />\nThe prestige of the scholar<br />\nin America is at an all time low.<br />\nRather than being viewed as an<br />\nambitious young man trying to<br />\nimprove his lot and that of the<br />\ngeneral community, he is seen as<br />\na sign - wielding, draft - dodging<br />\nsubversive who is prone to heavy<br />\ndrinking and unbridled revelry.<br />\nPetunia Dowager and Elsie Couponclipper sit at their lace-curtained windows and wait for<br />\nthose evil fraternity men to attempt to entertain themselves<br />\nafter a week of work and of untold pressure; out goes the call,<br />\nand in comes the riot squad.<br />\nWhen will they understand<br />\nthat to the Hopkins student,<br />\nlearning is a serious affair, and<br />\nthat the respite offered by fraternal activity is important?<br />\nRush is by its nature loud. People go from, house to house. But<br />\nIt's only two weeks, and it's an<br />\nIntegral part of the system.<br />\nGranted, the city of Baltimore<br />\nIts about due for a police crackdown. Perhaps it will help to<br />\nmake up for the almost clownish<br />\nIneptitude shown in the past,<br />\nbut why must it be centered at<br />\nHopkins fraternities? Could it be<br />\nbecause fraternity residents are<br />\nnot Baltimore residents? Could It<br />\nbe because they are here when<br />\nthey should be in Vietnam? Or<br />\ncould it be because they will not<br />\npay off?<br />\n<br />\n\fmr<br />\n<br />\nCIARC.TC CW.8<br />\n<br />\n7nrSg g3LTVN<br />\n@Wiaeicifiig<br />\n<br />\nmeeLin,<br />\n<br />\n2<br />\n<br />\n)3Y BOBBY Tzw-G.<br />\n(ase imen\u00b1y-ercshti- )<br />\nread the<br />\n--MUITLites of -LII-e<br />\n<br />\nMarie<br />\n<br />\n43 cAndiLlateg: they<br />\nIan to officially<br />\nPtcppost ino,slly<br />\n<br />\n.16<br />\n<br />\nTEE liNDA * . \u2022<br />\nleJlifin<br />\n<br />\n-because<br />\n<br />\n\u2022Tigl'ilt<br />\n15,<br />\nt -really<br />\n'2that's<br />\n<br />\ngirt<br />\n<br />\nt&Greid-uare<br />\n<br />\nThe conaittriionn,aalfes it possib]e<br />\nfor the Thcecutive<br />\nthey becpri loan/ bc,Be dec wa<br />\nT11ell<br />\nto tall( about- the.<br />\nby only<br />\nContest\u2014<br />\nBari .2.i.1 They bad<br />\n<br />\n2.0<br />\n<br />\n7.<br />\n<br />\nou b of the<br />\n<br />\nreceived a lot of<br />\n<br />\n00<br />\n<br />\nba 1io t& from, ,<br />\nmerabers - ier'<br />\n<br />\nAnemlevs of We<br />\n<br />\n><br />\nanci-la<br />\n4,r4<br />\np&pYe 111\u00b0Sr101<br />\n<br />\n)1Wif<br />\n1-6<br />\n<br />\ncata),<br />\nla<br />\n<br />\nthe<br />\n<br />\nr<br />\nTTEICLatla<br />\n:Ae<br />\neffi<br />\nGlfittD<br />\ne In<br />\nl<br />\n(3- 411?

It would<br />\nbe very easy for her to lie, or<br />\nsimply to distort facts, in order<br />\nto revenge herself upon a boy<br />\nwho had treated her badly.<br />\nWe are sure that Miss Lucot's<br />\nmotives in writing that letter<br />\nwere not these; however, the<br />\nfact remains that her letter is<br />\npoor evidence against an entire<br />\nfraternity. If we believed that a<br />\nletter written by a Hopkins boy<br />\naccusing us of violations of our<br />\nSocial Honor Code would be accepted as evidence against us by<br />\nour Judicial Board, we would<br />\nlose much of our respect for the<br />\nBoard's judgment.<br />\nWe feel that, in a matter such<br />\nas this, which concerns only<br />\nJohns Hopkins University, only<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins community should be permitted to<br />\ntestify against a fraternity. We<br />\nare aware of the fact that I.F.C.<br />\nhas an obligation to the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity to control its member organizations; we feel that<br />\nIt also has a responsibility to the<br />\nAdministration of the Univer-<br />\n<br />\nsity, as well as the students, to<br />\nuse fair and equitable measures<br />\nin exercising this control.<br />\nIt seems to us that condemning one group on the basis of<br />\nevidence which is not only largely hearsay but also comes from<br />\nsomeone outside of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity is more of a threat<br />\nto the fraternity system than<br />\nany of Phi Psi's supposed violations of Social Probation.<br />\nDeborah Dill, Patricia Suttles,<br />\nSara Pitts, Lucy Tuttle, Jan<br />\nKramer, Liz Sternberg, Linda?,<br />\nVicky Rider, Vicki Meyer, Jackie<br />\nLaske, Doris Messic, Eleanor<br />\nWilansky, Diana Wylie, Barbara<br />\nRichards, Susan Gibbens, Gail<br />\nManser, Peggy<br />\nHawn, Gail<br />\nDubois, Sally McCume, Sally<br />\nCampell, Susan Cannon, Dora<br />\nMahar, Allyson Davies, Karen<br />\nGILSOO, Marjorie Cox, Sarah Messengate, Nancy Lange, Betsey<br />\nCraig, Metty Gage, Beke Willoughby, Madeline Sox.<br />\n<br />\nArs..<br />\n<br />\nsib<br />\n<br />\nSophomore Reform Forum<br />\nHoping to encourage more student participation in the university reform issue, the sophomore class has scheduled a Student - Administration<br />\nForum<br />\nWednesday, March 9, in the<br />\nEisenhower<br />\nLibrary's Garrett<br />\nRoom.<br />\n\"You can't reform what you<br />\ndon't understand,\" said sophomore class president Jack Kirk.<br />\n\"We want to give every student<br />\nthe chance to know where the<br />\nadministration stands on the<br />\nmost talked-about problems.\"<br />\nThe forum will provide the<br />\nstudent the opportunity to confront University administrators<br />\nwith any questions on school<br />\npolicies.

A committee which met two weeks ago reported that<br />\nsufficient funds were obtained, and the attendance at<br />\nthe meeting indicated at least a starting enthusiasm for<br />\nthe program, yet the summer school idea was indefinitely postponed for lack of a leader.<br />\nThis excuse is not satisfactory. There must be any<br />\nnumber of Hopkins personnel who would jump at an<br />\nopportunity to kick off such a program. Victor Dates,<br />\nthe new Negro appointee would appear to be an ideal<br />\nperson for the position.<br />\nBy this suspension of activity for the summer<br />\nschool program, we do not question the integrity of<br />\nthose involved. But if advances are to be made toward<br />\nconstructive community action, let them not be idle<br />\nadvances, but rather advances accompanied by enthusiasm and good intentions.<br /><br />\nGrad Bag<br />\nThe founders of the graduate club deserve to<br />\nbe commended. They expended effort on a project that<br />\nmost graduate students would hardly disdain to cooperate with.<br />\nSo why object to a few eager beavers who have<br />\ntaken a -super-genuine interest in this dub project,<br />\nwhose eagerness has resulted in some trivial usurpations of power? They have after all obtained this power<br />\nby default.<br />\nThe answer is obvious. While the graduate students<br />\nhave always effected a calculated unconcern toward school<br />\nfunctions, have purposely limited their environment by<br />\ntheir discipline, are unwilling to give themselves away<br />\nby displaying corporate enthusiasm, and consequently<br />\nhave hardly a leg to stand on for asserting a justifiable<br />\noffensive against these righteous and self-styled potentates, they still must obey their convictions. And an issue<br />\nhas arisen lately which has rightly offended many of<br />\nthe graduate students. A graduate executive body has<br />\nbeen formed which pretends to speak for the students<br />\nwithout their legitimate consent, and which insists on<br />\ndeliberating on matters far beyond what is generally<br />\nagreed to be within their legitimate concern.<br />\nThe cartoon on page five has expressed this discontent most expertly. Leave well enough alone, may<br />\nwe advise; by pretending to represent the graduate<br />\nstudents on any other than social issues not only misrepresents the students, but also misrepresents the truth<br />\nthat such a body is a useful addition to the university.<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nCommittee Runs Riot<br /><br />\nBusiness Managers<br />\nWilliam Schenck<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, FEBRUARY 25, 1966<br /><br />\nBy HENRY J. KORN<br />\nWith the advent of warm<br />\nweather the time has come to<br />\nreport to the student body on<br />\nplans for the 1966 Spring Riot.<br />\nIn years past riots have failed<br />\nfor a number of reasons but a<br />\nclear over-all cause in each case<br />\nhas been a simple lack of careful planning. To correct the situation selected student leaders<br />\nwere chosen in the Fall of 1965<br />\nto serve on the Undergraduate<br />\nRiot Committee.<br />\nIgnoring the all too clear lessons inherent in the failure of<br />\nthe Intermok Rally in the Spring<br />\nof 1965 the committee spent<br />\nmost of its initial sessions conducting a detailed analysis of<br />\nthe collapse of the last nearriot in the Spring of 1964. At<br />\nthat time a misplaced waterbomb fell from the window of a<br />\nFreshman Dorm House onto the<br />\nhead of a lower echalon member<br />\nof the administration. Any question of intent or any second<br />\nthoughts of the aim on the part<br />\nof the bomb thrower were upon<br />\nthe point of burst, academic. In<br />\nany case the quadrangle soon filled with a mass of Freshmen all<br />\nwondering what they would do<br /><br />\nnext.<br /><br />\nAd Hock<br /><br />\nAt last the mood of the mob<br />\nturned ugly and a courageous<br />\nmember of the class screamed<br />\n\"Everybody<br />\nout<br />\nto<br />\nCharles<br />\nStreet!\" At that moment the<br />\ndorm masters intervened forming a cordon across the parking<br />\nlot. A dorm master countered<br /><br />\nwith \"anyone has crosses into<br />\nthe street will get, his name turned in to the Dean.\" The crowd<br />\ntook the threat to heart and<br />\nwent back to the snack bar to<br />\nwatch television. The Committee<br />\nrealized that if someone had been<br />\non hand to handle the challenge<br />\nby slugging the nearest dormnaster the rest could have proeeeded to Charles Street where<br />\nthe opportunities for destruction, and violence are everywhere.<br />\nThus in the 1966 riot the<br />\ncommittee will have strategically placed a group of foul-mouthed louts recruited from the area<br />\nto insure a minimum of success. The date for the Spring<br />\nRiot has been tentively set for<br />\nWednesday, March 16th. Although the committee has been<br />\nworking hard _ to make this<br />\nyear's riot the most destructive<br />\nand anti-social in Hopkins Hisstory there is much work yet to<br />\nbe done. The support of everyone is required for any real<br />\nsenseless brutality to take place.<br />\nAll suggestions should be placed<br />\nin a plain brown wrapper and<br />\naddressed to the Committee in<br />\ncare of the Office of Special<br />\nEvents.<br /><br />\nKeystone Keggery<br /><br />\nBy HENRY M. HOCHERMAN<br />\nIt has often been said that the<br />\ncity of Baltimore, culture center<br />\nof the great Southeast, lacks an<br />\nadequate repertory troupe, a<br />\ngroup of roving players and jesters to provide inexpensive entertainment for the masses. In<br />\ntruth, however, such a group<br />\nhas long existed and continues<br />\nto exist. Its stage Is built from<br />\nthe myriad streets of Baltimore,<br />\nand its only ceiling is the sky.<br />\nThey are dramatic, they are<br />\nnumerous, but most of all they<br />\nare comical. They dress in suits<br />\nof blue, and call themselves the<br />\nBaltimore City Police.<br /><br />\nbut most of all they are inept.<br />\nThey are out to stem the tide<br />\nof lawlessness which threatens<br />\nour fair city. Where are they to<br />\nbe found? Are they surrounding<br />\nthe Burlesque houses on Baltimore Street? Are they raiding<br />\ngamblers, shutting down illicit<br />\nlotteries? Are they arresting the<br />\nstreet walkers on Greenmount<br />\nAvenue? Are they cornering the<br />\nholders of overdue library books?<br />\nWrong! They are out for bigger<br />\ngame.<br />\nThey seek the evil ruffians who<br />\nendanger the Monumental City.<br />\nA street corner gang perhaps?<br />\nWrong again! The Baltimore Police, fearless, mindless, are attacking those seething hotbeds of<br />\npinko insurrestion, those monuments to sin, the Hopkins fraternities. And why not, there is no<br />\nother evil in Baltimore with<br />\nwhich they can occupy themselves. Everything else has been<br />\ncleaned up.<br /><br />\nTransport yourself now to the<br />\nfateful night of February 18,<br />\n1966. Danger stalks the Baltimore night. The placid skyline<br />\nweeps as evil rears its ugly head.<br />\nMinors are corrupted, and honest Southern virgins are threatened. The police, always quick,<br />\nalways ready, those stalwart defenders of justice who always<br />\nget their man, are out en Masse.<br />\nFriday night's performance<br />\nThey are fearless, they are true, causes this reporter to wonder<br />\n111111111110<br />\n,<br />\nIP+<br /><br />\neaued.panciefrtee\u2014<br />\nTO The Editor:<br />\nMost graduate students have<br />\nassumed the functions of the<br />\nGraduate Club to be social and<br />\nathletic. These functions have<br />\nbeen performed well by the present Executive Committee, juvenile in tone as it appears. The<br />\nthe<br />\nAdministration<br />\naccepts<br />\ngroup as representative of the<br />\ngraduate student body.<br />\nThe effort expended by the<br />\ncurrent Executive Committee in<br />\ncreation of a graduate organization cannot be discounted. Many<br />\nof their ideas and actions, especially in the area of recreation,<br />\nare valuable and have filled a<br />\ndefinite need on the Hopkins<br />\ncampus. Their entry into things<br />\npolitical should be strongly disgiven<br />\ncouraged, however.

It would<br />\nbe very easy for her to lie, or<br />\nsimply to distort facts, in order<br />\nto revenge herself upon a boy<br />\nwho had treated her badly.<br />\nWe are sure that Miss Lucot's<br />\nmotives in writing that letter<br />\nwere not these; however, the<br />\nfact remains that her letter is<br />\npoor evidence against an entire<br />\nfraternity. If we believed that a<br />\nletter written by a Hopkins boy<br />\naccusing us of violations of our<br />\nSocial Honor Code would be accepted as evidence against us by<br />\nour Judicial Board, we would<br />\nlose much of our respect for the<br />\nBoard's judgment.<br />\nWe feel that, in a matter such<br />\nas this, which concerns only<br />\nJohns Hopkins University, only<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins community should be permitted to<br />\ntestify against a fraternity. We<br />\nare aware of the fact that I.F.C.<br />\nhas an obligation to the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity to control its member organizations; we feel that<br />\nIt also has a responsibility to the<br />\nAdministration of the Univer-<br /><br />\nsity, as well as the students, to<br />\nuse fair and equitable measures<br />\nin exercising this control.<br />\nIt seems to us that condemning one group on the basis of<br />\nevidence which is not only largely hearsay but also comes from<br />\nsomeone outside of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity is more of a threat<br />\nto the fraternity system than<br />\nany of Phi Psi's supposed violations of Social Probation.<br />\nDeborah Dill, Patricia Suttles,<br />\nSara Pitts, Lucy Tuttle, Jan<br />\nKramer, Liz Sternberg, Linda?,<br />\nVicky Rider, Vicki Meyer, Jackie<br />\nLaske, Doris Messic, Eleanor<br />\nWilansky, Diana Wylie, Barbara<br />\nRichards, Susan Gibbens, Gail<br />\nManser, Peggy<br />\nHawn, Gail<br />\nDubois, Sally McCume, Sally<br />\nCampell, Susan Cannon, Dora<br />\nMahar, Allyson Davies, Karen<br />\nGILSOO, Marjorie Cox, Sarah Messengate, Nancy Lange, Betsey<br />\nCraig, Metty Gage, Beke Willoughby, Madeline Sox.<br /><br />\nArs..<br /><br />\nsib<br /><br />\nSophomore Reform Forum<br />\nHoping to encourage more student participation in the university reform issue, the sophomore class has scheduled a Student - Administration<br />\nForum<br />\nWednesday, March 9, in the<br />\nEisenhower<br />\nLibrary's Garrett<br />\nRoom.<br />\n\"You can't reform what you<br />\ndon't understand,\" said sophomore class president Jack Kirk.<br />\n\"We want to give every student<br />\nthe chance to know where the<br />\nadministration stands on the<br />\nmost talked-about problems.\"<br />\nThe forum will provide the<br />\nstudent the opportunity to confront University administrators<br />\nwith any questions on school<br />\npolicies.
