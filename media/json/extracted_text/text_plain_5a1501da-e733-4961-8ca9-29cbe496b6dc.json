Great expense is being<br />\ntaken to provide us with the<br />\nmost modern, efficient library<br />\nservice possible and at the same<br />\ntime to create pleasant and comfortable surroundings.<br />\nIt is with some dismay therefore that the Student Council<br />\nhas received reports from the<br />\nUniversity Librarian, Mr. Berthel, that unnecessary and unfortunate acts of vandalism<br />\nhave occurred. No accusations<br />\nhave been made, but each of us<br />\nwho use the library should feel<br />\nin part responsible for it. Its<br />\nmaintenance and services are<br />\ndependent upon our treatment.<br />\nThe Student Council realizes<br />\nthat it is not its place to try to<br />\npolice students using the library<br />\nfacilities, but it is the place for<br />\neach student to police himself.<br />\nWe encourage each member of<br />\nthe Hopkins community to develop a feeling of pride and responsibility toward the new library. Use the facilities to their<br />\nfullest but in so doing, try to<br />\nmaintain them.

Such a certificate<br />\nostensibly entitles bearer to think of undergraduates as<br />\na lower form of life, uneducated and unfit for association. Such graduate students are not usually bears, so<br />\nmuch as they are bees. Having tasted the sweet dew of<br />\nsome academic success, having received a first degree<br />\nthough harassed by the bears in the process, these bees<br />\nare quick to sting the undergraduates flung into their<br />\npath by the system which provides the bears.

It is more perplexing,<br />\nhowever, that one's superiority in amount or integration<br />\nof knowledge should result in his being convinced of<br />\nsome total human superiority.

Such a certificate<br />\nostensibly entitles bearer to think of undergraduates as<br />\na lower form of life, uneducated and unfit for association. Such graduate students are not usually bears, so<br />\nmuch as they are bees. Having tasted the sweet dew of<br />\nsome academic success, having received a first degree<br />\nthough harassed by the bears in the process, these bees<br />\nare quick to sting the undergraduates flung into their<br />\npath by the system which provides the bears. No one<br />\ncan be more self-important than a graduate student,<br />\nunless one is a faculty member.<br />\nA position on the faculty of one of the nation's<br />\nmost prestigious universities (a graduate school of<br />\ngreat renown, that is) sometimes turns men into bears.<br />\nBears scowl.<br />\nWhy must a position of certified expertise be construed as entailing the rights of a god, junior grade?<br />\nWhile we might understand arrogance on the part of<br />\nan expert while he is dealing with matters in his own<br />\nfield, we would not then excuse it. It is more perplexing,<br />\nhowever, that one's superiority in amount or integration<br />\nof knowledge should result in his being convinced of<br />\nsome total human superiority.

Student leaders, nice guys though<br />\nmost of them are, can he very officious in matters of<br />\nstate, and somtimes outrage even the Arews-Letter by<br />\ntheir self-importance.<br />\nIn some of the better undergraduate scholars, one<br />\nmay observe the attitudes of the noisome bees developing as they grow into graduate students, and even the<br />\nmost common of the undegraduates can scoff at the<br />\n\"Metoy-poloi.\"<br />\nPerhaps academic truth sets one free, liberates<br />\none from the chains of common courtesy and respect<br />\ndue any man who has not proven himself unworthy.<br />\nPerhaps an academic license provides such liberty.<br />\nWe are aware that though we may all be made of<br />\nthe same clay, a vase is not a jug.

Should he be a government official who will explain government policy, or can<br />\nwe assume that Hopkins students do read newspapers?<br />\nOr, as some suspect, should he be a vehicle by which<br />\nHopkins can get national publicity.<br />\nWe believe that the role of the commencement<br />\nspeaker is none of these. Commencement day should<br />\ninclude a pause allowing the student to reflect upon his<br />\nnature, his achievements, his frustrations, and his<br />\naspirations. A simple, well-chosen poetry reading might<br />\nstimulate such reflection far better than soaring rhetoric.<br />\nThe beauty of Beethoven's Third Symphony or<br />\nTchaikovsky's Sixth as played by a superb orchestra<br />\nmight stimulate such reflection far better than the cold<br />\nlogic of a brilliant educator or statesman.<br />\nCommencement is perhaps the most significant day<br />\nin the life of the University.
