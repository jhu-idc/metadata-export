This year the admissions office received everything from comic strips<br />\nto a rubber stamp that says \"J.H. Admits<br />\nLen.\" One applicant came in for an interview and performed magic tricks with a<br />\ntop hat and disappearing flowers.<br />\nThe essay question this year asked the applicants to describe a humorous event from<br />\ntheir personal experiences. Schnydman's<br />\nfavorite essay was the one about the kid<br />\nwho broke the toilet seat and tried to fix<br />\nit with Super Glue. His mother used the<br />\ntoilet only moments after the accident and<br />\nwas promptly glued to the seat.<br />\nNot all applications are as memorable,<br />\nhowever, and since the admissions committee reads about forty applications a day,<br />\nthe process can become tedious. Admissions officers are forced to look for<br />\ndistinguishing features that set an applicant<br />\napart from the rest.<br />\n\"We have what we call 'Special Interest<br />\nGroups,\u2014 said India Lowres, the senior<br />\nassistant director of admissions. \"Those<br />\ninclude children of alumni, minorities,<br />\nathletes and VIPs. An applicant is a VIP<br />\nwhen an important person recommends<br />\nthem.\" Being in a special interest group,<br />\nhowever, does not guarantee admissions,<br />\nalthough it does help.<br />\nAs for athletes, some may believe that<br />\nlacrosse players will automatically gain admission, regardless of their academic<br />\nrecord. Not true, said the admissions director. \"All the students we admit, we feel<br />\ncan do the work,\" he said. \"There will<br />\nprobably be seven or eight lacrosse players<br />\ncoming in next year; that's 1.08 percent<br />\nof the applicant pool.\u2014 Schnydman himself<br />\nis a former midfielder for the Hopkins<br />\nlacrosse team in the mid 1960s.<br />\nLowres said, \"The only way we could<br />\nhave strong athletic teams is to give some<br />\nbreaks to the athletes, but not to the extent where we admit those who cannot survive here academically. Last year, for example, we rejected the number one<br />\nlacrosse recruit because we felt he did not<br />\nmeet our standards.\"<br />\nAnother characteristic that sets applicants apart from the rest include<br />\ngeographic diversity. \"We think<br />\n<br />\nOne<br />\n<br />\ngeographic diversity will bring lots of different points of view to the campus. . . added perspectives,\" said Schnydman. The applicant from Oregon, he said,<br />\nwould be favored over the applicant from<br />\nNew Jersey, all other credentials being<br />\nequal.<br />\nThis year, Hopkins will be making a<br />\nspecial effort to increase the geographic<br />\ndiversity of its students. \"For the first<br />\ntime, we'll be sending a representative on<br />\na tour of Europe,\" said Rachel Hendrickson, associate director of admissions.<br />\n\"This is our first venture abroad. Usually<br />\nforeign students seek us out because of our<br />\nreputation.\"<br />\nAnother part of the admission process<br />\nis the interview. Although it can be one of<br />\nthe most nerve-wracking experiences for<br />\ncollege applicants, the interview is only a<br />\nway to get applicants to see the school.<br />\nOnly twenty to twenty-five percent of all<br />\napplicants come for an interview, and<br />\nSchnydman said that attaching great impor-<br />\n<br />\nRichard A.

Thus, interviews do not have<br />\nmuch influence in whether a student is accepted to Hopkins. \"It only comes into<br />\nplay for the borderline cases,\" said<br />\nLowres.<br />\nEven after the mailing of acceptance/re-<br />\n<br />\nRichard A. Bell<br />\n<br />\nOutside the Admissions Office. For many, the beginning of life at Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\njection notices, however, the headaches do<br />\nnot end for the admissions staff. In the next<br />\nfew weeks, it will receive phone calls from<br />\nirate parents of students who have been<br />\nrefused admission.<br />\nLowres said, \"Most will want some<br />\ntangible reason as to why their son or<br />\ndaughter was rejected. In most cases, there<br />\nis nothing about that student that is terrible. We've turned down valedictorians<br />\nbefore because they were not competitive<br />\nenough within our applicant pool. It's a<br />\nvery hard thing to do.\"<br />\nSome parents rant and rave and even<br />\nread off a list of other colleges which have<br />\naccepted their son or daughter. Those<br />\nparents still have hope though. \"They can<br />\nalways write and ask for reconsideration,\"<br />\nsaid Hendrickson. The chances for acceptance after reconsideration, however, is<br />\nvery slim. Usually, only one applicant a<br />\nyear who is reconsidered is accepted, even<br />\nin light of new circumstances.<br />\nIn conclusion, Lowres stressed, \"We<br />\nare not a computerized office; we don't<br />\nplug the information into a computer and<br />\nexpect it to evaluate everyone.\" With<br />\nevery application read at least twice, the<br />\nprocess has a large human element.<br />\nHendrickson said, \"We [the Admissions<br />\nOffice] are only a part of the reasons why<br />\nstudents come here after they've been accepted.

Muller explained the three ways in which<br />\nthe University will attempt to<br />\nremedy the situation.<br />\nFirst, a special campaign for<br />\nArts and Sciences is being planned to raise revenue for the school.<br />\nMuller also described the<br />\nestablishment of the University<br />\nreserve fund, to which all branches of the University will<br />\ncontribute.<br />\n\"In the long run [the fund] is<br />\nnot intended to help any one division forever. . . in the short run it<br />\nwill assist Arts and Sciences,\"<br />\nsaid Muller.<br />\nFinally, Muller said it was<br />\nnecessary to reduce expenditures<br />\nwithin Arts and Sciences, and he<br />\nexplained the reasoning behind<br />\nthe five-year plan for the school<br />\nproposed by Arts and Sciences<br />\nDean Lloyd Armstrong Jr.<br />\nAccording to Muller, this plan<br />\nstipulates that the size of the Arts<br />\nand Sciences faculty is to be<br />\nreduced by ten percent\u2014about<br />\ntwenty-five faculty members\u2014<br />\nover the next five years. It also<br />\nrequires that the plans for the<br />\nrenovation of Gilman Hall and<br />\nchemistry building construction<br />\nbe delayed indefinitely.<br />\nMuller said that the reduction<br />\nwill occur largely through attrition. \"Attrition of the faculty is<br />\na marginal adjustment,\" said<br />\nMuller, who explained that the<br />\nfive-year plan will reduce the size<br />\nof the faculty from 255 to about<br />\n230\u2014the size it had been in 1982.<br />\nMuller said that the faculty<br />\nreduction will not be \"across the<br />\nboard,\" and that the administration will use this coming summer<br />\nto look more closely at ways in<br />\nwhich expenditures can be reduced.<br />\nThe construction delays, said<br />\nMuller, are necessary even<br />\nthough the work is to be funded<br />\nby the Series 1985A Revenue<br />\nbonds\u2014a package totalling $209<br />\nmillion and intended solely for<br />\nconstruction and renovation at the<br />\nHomewood campus. Muller said<br />\nthat the University can't continue<br />\nto incur debts for construction<br />\nwhile allowing Arts and Sciences<br />\nto operate with its burden.<br />\n\"If we had the ability to pay the<br />\ndebt, we have the money to do the<br />\nconstruction.\" he said.<br />\nMuller explained that new building adds expenses to the schools<br />\nbecause it adds debt to their<br />\nbudgets. \"The bond issue is not<br />\na gift, but a debt. . . if the money<br />\nis spent on Arts and Sciences,<br />\n[the school] must pay debt service.\"<br />\nMuller also commented on the<br />\ndecision regarding the successor<br />\nto Dean of Homewood Schools<br />\nAdministration Robert Welch.<br />\nThe position will be of Dean, said<br />\nMuller, except that he will report<br />\nto both academic deans of Arts<br />\nand Sciences and the G.W.C.<br />\nWhiting School of Engineering.<br />\nThe title of the new position is<br />\nDean of Student Services.<br />\nMuller described the reasons<br />\nbehind this choice of ad-<br />\n<br />\nministrative structure.

Reprinted<br />\nwith permission.<br />\nPart 2 of 2<br />\nAnother perennial criticism of<br />\nGreeks is that despite their professed interest in encouraging<br />\nacademic achievement, fraternity life actually impedes scholastic<br />\nperformance.<br />\nSurvey of Grades<br />\nThose criticisms are borne out<br />\npartially by a preliminary survey<br />\nissued in December by the Center<br />\nfor the Study of the College<br />\nFraternity, based in Bloomington,<br />\nInd. The survey found that in<br />\n1986, 37.1 percent of fraternity<br />\nmen polled had grade-point<br />\naverages below the national<br />\naverage for all male college<br />\nstudents. Only 22.8 percent had<br />\naverages exceeding the national<br />\nnorm.<br />\nAmong women sorority<br />\nmembers, on the other hand, 38.9<br />\npercent had grade-point averages<br />\nabove the norm for women, while<br />\nonly 19.1 percent had averages<br />\nbelow the norm.<br />\nDr. Wilder says his research on<br />\nBucknell's fraternities leads him<br />\nto conclude that fraternity life<br />\nitself is not responsible for what<br />\nhe calls \"distinctive differences\"<br />\nbetween fraternity members and<br />\nso-called independents. But he<br />\nsays the type of person who<br />\nchooses fraternity life is different<br />\nfrom the type who chooses to remain unaffiliated.<br />\n\"Fraternity members tend to<br />\nbe somewhat less intellectual,<br />\nsomewhat less academically<br />\nmotivated, and somewhat less<br />\nscholastically able,\" he says.<br />\n\"By contrast, Greeks appear to<br />\nbe probably better socially and<br />\nemotionally adjusted, more<br />\npopular, better regarded by peers.<br />\n<br />\nThey are the social glue that<br />\nkeeps the campus together.\"<br />\nDr. Wilder said Greeks also<br />\ntended to be more conformist and<br />\nless independent than non-Greeks<br />\nhe studied.<br />\nFor all the criticism, few are<br />\narguing that fraternities should be<br />\nabolished. A detailed 1983 study<br />\nat Stanford University laid out a<br />\nnumber of arguments in favor of<br />\nthe fraternity system. The report<br />\nof the study argued that the \"relationships formed in a fraternity or<br />\nsorority are frequently closer and<br />\nlonger lasting than the friendships<br />\nestablished elsewhere while one<br />\nis a student.\" It also said that<br />\nGreek organizations \"accelerate<br />\nsocial ease and comfort and the<br />\ndiscovery of one's common<br />\nbonds with other members of the<br />\ngroup.\"<br />\nFraternity officials interviewed<br />\nat the Dallas convention also<br />\nargued that many fraternity<br />\norganization were actively engaged in community service work,<br />\nbut that their good deeds were ignored amid accounts in the press<br />\nof drinking, hazing, and sexual<br />\nmisconduct. On many campuses,<br />\nthe officials noted, fraternities<br />\ntake the lead in fund raising efforts for a variety of causes.<br />\nAccess to Alcohol Curtailed<br />\nFraternities have also worked<br />\na deal with what many Greeks<br />\nthink is their most serious problem: alcohol abuse. Spurred in<br />\npart by tougher drinking laws, increases in liability insurance, and<br />\nthreats of litigation against fraternities and universities, many<br />\nfraternities and sororities have<br />\nbeen forced to severly curtail access to alcohol at house events.<br />\nMr. Brandt of the National<br />\nInter-Fraternity Conference said<br />\nthat almost 400 of the organization's 800 affiliated campuses had<br />\ninstituted so-called dry rushes, in<br />\nwhich alcohol is forbidden at<br />\n<br />\nevents for pledges.<br />\nMost fraternities say they<br />\nclosely patrol house parties to<br />\nprevent under-age drinking. At<br />\nSt. Joseph's University in<br />\nPhiladelphia, for instance, identity cards are checked ,frhen<br />\nstudents enter a fraternity party.<br />\nPeople 21 and older are given<br />\narm bands. Only those with arm<br />\nbands may drink.<br />\nSuch measures are not<br />\nfoolproof. Last fall the Pennsylvania State Liquor Control<br />\nBoard netted 350 under-age<br />\ndrinkers in a statewide sweep of<br />\ncolleges and fraternities.<br />\nSome students also argue that<br />\nthe new strictures on drinking in<br />\nfraternity houses in fact increases<br />\nthe chances of drinking-related<br />\naccidents.<br />\nAt Florida State University.<br />\nwhere the student-run InterFraternity Council last year banned most fraternity keg parties,<br />\nBarry N.

The office anticipates 735 of the 2200 applicants to<br />\nenroll; however, the actual number who attend<br />\nhas been higher in past years than the estimate.<br />\nFor Schnydman and his crew, the increased<br />\nnumber of applicants allows them to continue<br />\nto raise standards as well as diversify ethnically<br />\nand geographically. And the number of students<br />\nenrolling has been on the upswing for several<br />\nyears now. That's great news, on the one<br />\nhand. It means that Admissions is attracting<br />\nmore and more highly qualified students; in the<br />\nlong run, this can mean an increasingly competitive undergraduate atmosphere.<br />\nBut if you're going to have more kids, you've<br />\ngot to build a bigger house. And it seems like<br />\nthere are just no plans to build an addition right<br />\nnow.<br />\nFor the past three years, an increasing<br />\nnumber of freshmen have been housed offcampus in Rogers House and McCoy Hall.<br />\nWhile these have served as adequate temporary<br />\nsolutions, it is time that administrators find<br />\nsome way to provide on-campus housing for<br />\nall freshmen. Campus life at Hopkins is already<br />\nso fragmented, with nearly every student moving off-campus after freshman year; freshmen<br />\nshould be able to enjoy at least one year of true<br />\ncampus life with their classmates.<br />\nThe University has made an agreement to<br />\n<br />\npurchase two nearby buildings but has not yet<br />\nsaid what purpose they will serve. One of these<br />\nbuildings\u2014Ivy Hall\u2014is large apartment<br />\nbuilding but is as in need of renovation as are<br />\nRogers, McCoy and Wolman Halls. No<br />\nrenovation plans have been made for the near<br />\nfuture; it looks as if another crop of Jerry's kids<br />\nwill find home, come September, to be the rundown, inappropriate apartments of Rogers and<br />\nMcCoy.<br />\nAnd what about the academic atmosphere? Now that Dean of the School of Arts<br />\nand Sciences Lloyd Armstrong is tightening the<br />\nbelt around his departments with his five-year<br />\nplan, an ever-increasing student body would<br />\nseem only to aggravate the problem. It doesn't<br />\ntake a rocket scientist to see that more students<br />\nwill bring in more tuition dollars. This,<br />\nhowever, is only a temporary situation to a<br />\nlong-term problem. For as class sizes continue<br />\nto grow, the size of the faculty will decrease\u2014<br />\naccording to Armstrong's plan.<br />\nFurthermore, some faculty have expressed<br />\nconcern that the five-year plan will force departments to reduce expenditures by hiring fewer<br />\nteaching assistants; fewer TAs will mean reducing the number of students allowed in certain<br />\ncourses.<br />\nSo while each entering class continues to<br />\ngrow and improve, the quality of education and<br />\nstudent life is perhaps being undermined by<br />\nfinancial troubles. How long can Hopkins continue to attract the most qualified applicants if<br />\nit cannot offer them the best possible education and amenities once they arrive?<br />\n<br />\nA Greek Doubleheader<br />\nThe sign of strength is the ability to stand up<br />\nto pressure. The Greek system nationwide is<br />\nfeeling the strains of its own behavior. Fraternities are commiting acts which involve excessive drinking, hazing, and sexual and racial<br />\nintolerance to a degree which is disturbing to<br />\nuniversities and national fraternity organizations<br />\nalike.<br />\nIncidents have been bad enough to be concerned that universities or national organizations might be planning to hew local chapters<br />\nto preserve the system. And yet, while that has<br />\nocurred in three colleges\u2014Amherst, Colby, and<br />\nW liams\u2014many more schools are deciding instead<br />\nto take a careful look at themselves. At a time<br />\nof unprecedented interest in Greek life nationwide, it is appropriate for schools and nationals<br />\nto re-examine the Greek system and effect<br />\nchanges or discipline where it is necessary\u2014<br />\nnot to abolish Greek living.<br />\nPlausible explanations exist for why Greek<br />\nlife is experiencing such popularity. Perhaps<br />\nit is fine to be part of the establishment again,<br />\nafter the iconoclastic early 70s. Students see the<br />\nGreek system as providing social opportunity.<br />\nThe organizations as a whole provide tremendous social service to the school and community. There is enough inherently good about the<br />\nsystem to look for ways to improve it. Both<br />\nschools and national organizations need to work<br />\nwith local chapters and address intolerance<br />\nwhich tends to find fuel in fraternal<br />\norganizations.<br />\nHopkins' Greek woes are thankfully less<br />\nsevere than other incidents: there have been no<br />\ndeaths due to alcohol poisoning, nor have there<br />\nbeen explicit examples of hazing or racist activity. Nevertheless, Hopkins' recent experiences, particularly with TEP, are serious<br />\n<br />\nall the same.<br />\nTEP national and the dean of students' office handled the incident of sexual harassment<br />\ncommendably. The fraternity members involved deserve to be disciplined. The chapter, while<br />\nstill allowed to exist, will undergo a<br />\n\"recolonization,\" which will include interviews of the brothers by alumni and national<br />\nrepresentatvies to determine who represents the<br />\nfraternity's ideals and to weed out those who<br />\ndo not. In addition their social work will help<br />\neducate them as to the serious nature of the<br />\noffense.<br />\nThe Greek system at Hopkins is not cut down<br />\nby the incident. Because the offenders are<br />\nisolated and punished, the credibility of the<br />\nsystem is maintained; because the issue of intolerance is addressed,the system is made that<br />\nmuch stronger.<br />\nSig Ep national has acted so as not to undermine the Hopkins' Greek system as well. It has<br />\nnot closed its doors to Hopkins. It has simply<br />\nasked the present members to leave. The national hopes to reintroduce Sig Ep to Hopkins<br />\nin the future with new members and a new<br />\nattitude.<br />\nThe situation is an unfortunate one for<br />\nHopkins Sig Ep brothers. Sophomore brothers<br />\nrun a strong chance of seeing a new Sig Ep<br />\nbefore they graduate. This would be a strong<br />\nblow to that group which was just forced to go<br />\ninactive. Sig Ep national may have felt that they<br />\ncould no longer retain Hopkins' chapter within<br />\ntheir organization; however, it should still treat<br />\nthe individuals with the respect they have for<br />\nthe system. For the sake of those brothers, national Sig Ep should make no efforts to bring<br />\nSig Ep back to Hopkins until after the present<br />\nstudents have all moved on.<br />\n<br />\nA Little Leeway<br />\n<br />\nTall Steps<br />\nby A. Lee Davis<br />\nIf the blossoms adorning<br />\nHomewood show a bright mauve,<br />\nand you have a baby, and a carriage to put her in, there's really<br />\nno excuse not to go for a stroll.<br />\nI had a few errands I had to do<br />\non campus, so on Tuesday, I put<br />\nHannah in her pink jumper, rolled on her pink socks, wrapped<br />\nher in her pink blanket, then placed her into her super delux carriage. When I say deluxe, I mean<br />\nit. This is the carriage 007<br />\ndreamed about when he was still<br />\njust a decimal. One button activates the bullet-proof dome,<br />\nanother fires the heat-seeking<br />\nmissies, and a third emits an oil<br />\nslick to do in any would-be pursuer. I slipped on the Wayfarers,<br />\nand informed Hannah of our mission: trips to Maryland Hall, the<br />\nSAC office, the cashier's office.<br />\nthe bookstore. We synchronized<br />\nour watches at 9:45. I had to be<br />\non the steps of Gilman by 11 for<br />\nan oral exam.<br />\nAs the carriage and I entered<br />\nthe elevator, my mood suddenly<br />\nchanged. I thought of a column!<br />\nonce intended to write, which involved obtaining a wheelchair<br />\nfrom Wyman Park and seeing<br />\nhow easily I could get from class<br />\nto class. I decided that Hannah's<br />\nrather unwieldy carriage would<br />\nshow me just how accessible this<br />\ncampus is.<br />\nGetting out of McCoy was no<br />\nproblem. There's a ramp leading<br />\ndown the steps. Out we went into the bright Baltimore sunshine.<br />\nMy first stop was Maryland Hall.<br />\n<br />\nI walked up the campus entranceway, navigated the curbs,<br />\nthen bore left along the tarred<br />\nsidewalk. I got to the top of the<br />\nhill, beside the Barnstormer's<br />\nbuilding, and realized I needed to<br />\nseek an alternate route; the stairs<br />\nwere too steep, the hill too bumpy. I considered my options. I<br />\ncould go back the way I came,<br />\nhead down Charles, then back up<br />\nbehind the powerplant. Or I could<br />\ngo right, circle around MSE, and<br />\nscoot back down the inter-quad<br />\nsteps. I opted for the latter course<br />\nof action. Things went smoothly<br />\nuntil I got to the steps and faced<br />\nthe inevitable folly of my choice.<br />\nBeing able to walk down steps is<br />\na hard habit to get out of.<br />\nAgain I faced a decision. I<br />\ncould go into Rowland and take<br />\nthe elevator down to the bottom<br />\nquad level, or I could go to<br />\nGilman and take that elevator. I<br />\nhad learned from my first choice<br />\nto plan out my route. I couldn't<br />\ntake the Rowland elevator,<br />\nbecause as soon as I walked in the<br />\ndoor I was faced with a sneering<br />\nrow of steps. Besides, once! had<br />\ntaken the elevator down, I'd still<br />\nhave had to walk up another short<br />\nflight to get to Maryland.<br />\nI strolled to Gilman. On my<br />\nway I passed one of our injured<br />\nathletes on crutches, huffing as he<br />\nhopped up the inter-quad steps.<br />\nHe didn't have it so bad. At least<br />\nhe could hop. I arrived at Gilman,<br />\nbut what was I to do? I couldn't<br />\njust zoom up the steps under the<br />\nclock tower, and the stairways to<br />\n<br />\nSee LEEWAY, 12<br />\n<br />\nThe Hopkins<br />\n<br />\nNews-Letter<br />\nEditors<br />\nBrad Handler, Elizabeth Harrigan<br />\nBusiness Managers<br />\nJulie Levine, Flory Ware<br />\nManaging Editor<br />\nGlen Weiss<br />\nProduction Managers<br />\nAnn Ginsberg, Diana Zeiger<br />\nLayout Editor<br />\nEly Brown<br />\nNews Editors<br />\nKathleen McCarthy, Jonathan Stempel<br />\nArts Editors<br />\nPhil Gochenour, Mark W.

While I agree that the<br />\nproblems that some universities<br />\nare having with some fraternities<br />\n<br />\non their campuses should be<br />\npublicized, I believe that running<br />\nsuch an article without running a<br />\ncorresponding article which<br />\ndiscusses the benefits and positive<br />\naspects of fraternity behavior is<br />\nnot only misleading but also unfair to fraternities and sororities,<br />\nin particular those situated on this<br />\ncampus. Articles such as the one<br />\nrun last week present a disturbing picture of fraternities to facul-<br />\n<br />\nA Balto. Spring<br />\n1\u201d, Eric Ruck<br />\nAh, springtime in Baltimore. I<br />\ndon't know about you, but I'm<br />\nhappy that we are approaching<br />\nthe final countdown of weeks and<br />\ndays, because with the mild<br />\nweather here it's awfully difficult<br />\nto work. Right now I'm trying to<br />\nfigure out a way to lower my<br />\nword processor out my window<br />\nSO I can finish writing this article<br />\noutside. I guess there is one advantage to using pencil and paper<br />\nafter all.<br />\nI do have one recommendation.<br />\nEven though we do not have an<br />\noutdoor pool here at Hopkins, I<br />\nwould not recommend swimming<br />\nin the harbor, unless of course<br />\nyou can swim wearing the appropriate protective gear. If you<br />\nthink walking on water is difficult, I'd check out Fells Point.<br />\nBut so long as you remain dry,<br />\nthe harbor is a good place to go<br />\nin the spring. Aside from all the<br />\nnice, touristy shopping areas,<br />\nthey frequently have live entertainment and always have a nice<br />\nbreeze from the water. And best<br />\nof all, you can go ride the antique merry-go-round.<br />\nYes, it's spring, and it's nice to<br />\nsee birds aplenty again. They<br />\nmake terrible house pets, as they<br />\nare rather noisy and dirty, and<br />\nthey never want to be adorable<br />\nwhen you have time for them to<br />\nbe adorable. I envy them,<br />\n<br />\nalthough not because they fly or<br />\neven because they don't have<br />\nfinals looming over their<br />\nfeathered heads. But whenever I<br />\ngo outside there they are chasing<br />\neach other around, doing quite a<br />\nbit of chirping while they're at it.<br />\nWe all know what they're doing,<br />\nright'? If not, you've been hitting<br />\nthe textbooks too hard.<br />\nOf course not all birds are<br />\nperfect. Take the Orioles, for example. For those of you who<br />\ndon't follow local sports, the<br />\nOrioles aren't quite the team they<br />\nwere in 1983. In their opening<br />\ngame against the Milwaukee,<br />\nthey lost by, oh, twelve runs,<br />\nwith a final score of about twelve<br />\nto zero. Renaming the team \"The<br />\nBaltimore Lame Ducks\" is the<br />\nfirst thing that comes to mind if<br />\nwe were to stick with the bird<br />\nmotif.<br />\nHopkins must be a good place<br />\nfor the birds and the bees. Last<br />\nMonday an ABC film crew sat by<br />\nthe sports fields on University. If<br />\nyou didn't see them, it's too late,<br />\nas they were only here for one<br />\nday.

Annually. Phi Mu sponsors a Pastathon, a spaghetti dinner held to<br />\nraise money for the Johns<br />\nHopkins Childrens Center and the<br />\nChildren's Miracle Network. By<br />\nworking with community<br />\nbusinesses, we were able to raise<br />\nover $1,500 last year\u2014this year's<br />\ndinner, to be held April 29th,<br />\npromises to raise even more. We<br />\nalso annually raise money for<br />\nProject Hope, an organization<br />\nwhich supplies medical supplies<br />\nto third world and developing nations. We visit nursing homes,<br />\nchildrens hospitals, and are currently in the process of adopting<br />\na child in Brazil. This year, in<br />\nconjunction with Alpha Phi, we<br />\nplanned and sponsored a sexual<br />\nharrassment seminar for the<br />\nfreshman class. We partcipate in<br />\nalmost all other charity related activities, including the Phi Psi 500,<br />\nthe fundraiser for SAMS, and a<br />\ndrug awareness day for the<br />\nHopkins community,just to name<br />\na few.<br />\nBut my purpose is not to blow<br />\nPhi Mu's horn. . . all of the fraternitieis on this campus have actively been trying to become more involved with such beneficial projects as the ones mentioned<br />\nabove. The IFC, with trememdous support from the administration, has sought to make the<br />\nGreek system more cohesive and<br />\nrecognized as a positive organization.

Much to my surprise and to several of my<br />\nfriends', FAF's were due last Friday. What a stroke of genius! By<br />\nbarely publicizing the deadline<br />\n<br />\nfor the FAF, the funds the university saves from all the people who<br />\nmissed the deadline can go to correcting the deficit.<br />\nOkay, the theory is ludicrous.<br />\nHowever, the implications of<br />\npeople missing the deadline are<br />\nnot. Without financial aid quite a<br />\nnumber of people at Hopkins are<br />\nplaced in jeopardy. That, of<br />\ncourse, was an extremely obvious<br />\nstatement but one wonders what<br />\nwas on the minds of those in<br />\n<br />\nFinancial Aid. So,just as a footnote to all those who haven't<br />\nheard, FAF's were due April 1st<br />\nand the Hopkins Supplemental<br />\nFinancial Aid Application with<br />\nsupporting documents need to be<br />\nturned in by April 19th. GSL applications, on the other hand,<br />\nshould be submitted to your bank<br />\nby June 15th to secure equal consideration. Good luck.<br />\nOne wonders what Financial<br />\nAid will have due on April Fool's<br />\n<br />\nDay next year.<br />\nJosh Knights<br />\n<br />\nViolating MSE Privacy<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nSomething has been bothering<br />\nme lately. At apparently random<br />\nintervals, library security has asked to check my bag going into the<br />\nlibrary. In the past days of bomb<br />\nthreats O.K., but why today? I<br />\n<br />\nA Little More Leeway<br />\nLEEWAY, from 10<br />\nthe left and the right split up and<br />\ndown in their circular gyrations.<br />\nI had made a mistake at the very<br />\nstart.<br />\nI spun on my heels, pushed the<br />\ncarriage all the way back down<br />\nCharles, behind the powerplant,<br />\nand up to the lower quad. I passed Shriver and laughed to myself:<br />\nit's too bad every building didn't<br />\nhave a ramp, albeit a gratuitous<br />\none. Next door, I comtemplated<br />\nMaryland Hall. It had always<br />\nbeen a friendly building to me, in<br />\nspite of the unsatisfactory grades<br />\nI received there.<br />\nBut as I peered through the<br />\nwindows at the steps that prohibited my entrance, it seemed<br />\nvery cold. Maryland would wait,<br />\nI said to Hannah, and moved<br />\ntowards Merryman to see if a<br />\nreimbursement had come in.<br />\nIt wasn't my day, as again, a<br />\nsteep set of stairs prevented me<br />\n<br />\nfrom descending into the basement of the building. It was approaching 11, so the SAC office<br />\nalso had to wait. But I still had to<br />\ngo to the bookstore. I walked to<br />\nGilman the way I usually do, past<br />\nthe Glass Pavilion, towards the<br />\nEasy Bank entrance. I couldn't go<br />\nup those stairs though, so I had<br />\nto take the path to the left behind<br />\nthe building, underneath the windows of the Hut. Surprise, surprise: the only thing the path led<br />\nto was more steps. I worked my<br />\nway behind the shrubbery, and at<br />\nlast entered the bottom floor of<br />\nGilman.<br />\nI hoped things were now going<br />\nto get easier, but when I saw the<br />\nfamiliar turnstile at the bottom of<br />\nthe familiar steps, I knew I was<br />\nonce again in trouble. But I had<br />\nto get my book, so I lifted the carriage up and carried it down the<br />\nstairs. I squeezed out some blood<br />\nfor Barnes & Noble, then left the<br />\nway I had come in.<br />\n<br />\nThe clock rang eleven. I had to<br />\nget upstairs. There was an<br />\nelevator. I knew, so I rung<br />\naround the rosie until I found it<br />\nnear the northern corner of tue<br />\nbuilding. I anxiously pressed the<br />\nbutton. I couldn't be late. I exited<br />\nthe sliding doors, went down the<br />\nramps into the coffee shop area,<br />\nand prepared to leave. Again<br />\nmore steps. How ironic: with<br />\ndoorways all around me, I was utterly trapped. I went back up the<br />\nramp to a corner stairway, lifted<br />\nthe carriage up and carried it<br />\ndown the stairs out onto the steps<br />\nof Gilman, where I was to meet<br />\nmy T.A.<br />\nThe test went well, but as I<br />\nwalked back I knew I had<br />\ncheated\u2014not on the exam, but on<br />\nthe little experiment I had decided to undertake. Who could<br />\nblame me? After all, I was tired<br />\nfrom my efforts, frustrated at my<br />\ninability to get where I had to go,<br />\nforced into tardiness by my cir-<br />\n<br />\ncumlocutions through campus. I<br />\nknew I wouldn't be able to handle this day after day. After all,<br />\nwhen you're in a wheelchair, you<br />\ncan't just decide you've had<br />\nenough, as I did, when faced with<br />\nyet another set of stairs. You<br />\ncan't just say \"Oh, well,\" hop<br />\nout of the chair, and carry it down<br />\nthe steps the way I carried the<br />\ncarriage. A statement as innocuous as \"meet me on the steps<br />\nof Gilman\" can be a sentence to<br />\nhard labor.<br />\nI tried to recall seeing anyone<br />\nwho was confined to a wheelchair<br />\non campus. There was a guy from<br />\nfreshman year, a real nice kid. He<br />\ntransferred\u2014if I remember<br />\ncorrectly\u2014before<br />\nthe semester was even out. As I<br />\npushed the carriage homeward, I<br />\nwondered why he left Hopkins,<br />\nbut since I couldn't remember his<br />\nname or what school he transferred to, I'd never know.<br />\n<br />\nunderstand that food attracts insects, and insects damage books,<br />\nso the idea is to keep the food out<br />\nof the library. Fine. But does random harassment accomplish this?<br />\nSigns are posted throughout the<br />\nlibrary so that anyone who can<br />\nread knows that food is forbidden. Apparently the MSE has no<br />\nfaith in the student body.<br />\nPerhaps I wouldn't be as annoyed if the searches weren't so<br />\npointless and inconsistently administered. Some guards simply<br />\nneed an ID. Others request us to<br />\nopen our bag, but usually don't<br />\neven look inside! WHY<br />\nBOTHER!! Also if I was intent<br />\non bringing food into the library,<br />\nI could simply stick some in a<br />\npocket and none would be the<br />\nwiser. The whole ordeal is an annoyance, an insulting violation of<br />\nprivacy based on a lack of trust.<br />\nA better solution would be to provide a STUDY LOUNGE<br />\nWHERE FOOD IS ALLOWED!! Yes, the freshmen have the<br />\nAMR I lounge, but it is usually<br />\ncrowded, and where does this<br />\nleave the upperclassmen? In our<br />\ndays of budget woes, this hardly<br />\nseems like a priority, but can the<br />\nadministration at least give this a<br />\nthought? If nothing else, we could<br />\nend the useless incoming bookbag<br />\nsearches.

Leaving his lab at Cornell University. where he is doing graduate work in Materials<br />\nScience Engineering, McNamee<br />\nwill spend his summer canoeing<br />\nin the Canadian Arctic. He will<br />\nbe one of two Americans on an<br />\ninternational expedition which is<br />\npart of Operation Raleigh, a fouryear program started by Prince<br />\nCharles of Britain in 1984.<br />\nAs Prince Charles writes in a<br />\nstatement about the project, \"The<br />\ntheme of Operation Raleigh is<br />\nscience and service.<br />\n\"Young men and women from<br />\nvastly different backgrounds will<br />\nwork together on. . . projects set<br />\nup by multinational teams of experienced explorers and scientists, in unfamiliar places and<br />\noften under conditions of<br />\nhardship.<br />\n\"As well as making some practical contribution to a better<br />\nworld, they may grow to respect<br />\neach others' cultures and attitudes<br />\nand thus help to break some of the<br />\n<br />\n/\".<br />\n<br />\n87' Grad Scott McNamee, who (hopefully) will be mapping the uncharted Canadian Arctic this summer.<br />\nbarriers of prejudice and intolerance which have always existed. but which seem to be even<br />\nmore obvious in today's world.\"<br />\nTo date Operation Raleigh has<br />\nhelped with cataract operations in<br />\nSouth America, found ancient<br />\ncave art in Australia, and worked on other civic and scientific<br />\nprojects in 32 different countries.<br />\nThe program confronts its venturers, aged 17 to 24, with four<br />\nchallenges: the selection process,<br />\nthe problem of raising $5500 tui-,<br />\nlion, the expedition itself, and the<br />\ncompletion of 300 hours of com-<br />\n<br />\nmunity service upon their return.<br />\nMcNamee met the first<br />\nchallenge when he put in his application and was invited to a<br />\n\"selection weekend\" with 17<br />\nother prospective venturers. The<br />\napplicants went camping with<br />\nprogram staff, who gave them<br />\n\"hard work, little sleep, and less<br />\nfood,\" McNamee says, \"to see<br />\nwho could cope with the harsh<br />\nconditions you often find on expedition.\u2014 He did well enough to<br />\nbe chosen as one of the venturers.<br />\nHe is still working on his second challenge, which is to raise<br />\n<br />\nexpedition itself. 24 venturers<br />\nfrom 12 different countries will<br />\nspend the summer canoeing 600<br />\nmiles up the Kazan River in the<br />\nKeewatin District of the Northwest Territory of Canada. This<br />\narea has never been mapped<br />\nbefore except by air.

When the<br />\nexpedition reaches Baker Lake in<br />\nmid-August, its members will<br />\nspend two weeks with an Inuit<br />\nEskimo tribe.<br />\nThe trip will be dangerous as<br />\nwell as exciting. In the bitter cold,<br />\nan overturned canoe could be a<br />\nlife-or-death situation. Animals<br />\npose another danger, though<br />\nMcNamee does admit he hopes<br />\nthey'll see a bear just as long as<br />\nhe's had his share to eat first!\"<br />\nThe group's only contact with the<br />\noutside world will be via shortwave radio, so McNamee is learning to use one in preparation for<br />\nhis trip. He is also working to improve his physical condition, by<br />\nrunning and lifting weights.<br />\nMcNamee looks forward to the<br />\nfourth challenge, 300 hours of<br />\ncommunity service. He has<br />\nalways enjoyed volunteer work,<br />\nand says he thinks of this task as<br />\na way of thanking the community that make his going possible.<br />\nHis own sense of community will<br />\ngrow as he lives and works with<br />\nthe Eskimoes and with his fellow<br />\nventurers.<br />\n<br />\n$5500 by April 15.

Stewart<br />\nPerhaps more than any other<br />\ncomposer of the punk age, David<br />\nSylvian has succeeded in<br />\ntranscending the restrictions of<br />\nhis origins to create music that is<br />\nboth original and compelling. His<br />\nfirst band, Japan, got their start<br />\nplaying embarrassingly bad glamrock, complete with make-up,<br />\nflares, and platform shoes. They<br />\ncalled their first album, Adolescent Sex. Fortunately, they stuck<br />\nwith it and later albums such as<br />\nGentlemen Take Polaroids and<br />\nTin Drum revealed an almost entirely different band, one that had<br />\ndiscovered the ideas of space and<br />\nsubtlety. They still took their cues<br />\nfrom some other bands (Roxy<br />\nMusic with their understated<br />\n<br />\nmusical sensibility, in particular),<br />\nbut they were on their way to<br />\nsomething entirely new, and<br />\nDavid Sylvian was leading them.<br />\nSylvian's first solo album after<br />\nJapan split up was called Brilliant<br />\nTrees and it was primarily a continuation of the work he had<br />\nstarted with Japan. By his second<br />\nalbum, Gone to Earth an expansive two record set, however,<br />\nSylvian began to reach farther,<br />\nand his ambition got the better of<br />\nhim on more than a few occasions. Split between instrumentals<br />\nand vocal pieces, the album<br />\npresents the same musical<br />\ndichotomy presented at Sylvian's Wednesday night \"In<br />\nPraise Of Shamens\" concert\u2014<br />\nlong and directionless or concise<br />\nand poetic.<br />\n<br />\nRight from the opening instrumental, \"Words with the<br />\nShaman: Incantations\" you know<br />\nthat you are not in for a night of<br />\nexcitement. Rythmically, the<br />\npiece begins slowly and proceeds<br />\nin funeral march fashion until it<br />\nreaches its stopping point. There<br />\nis no melodic development either.<br />\nSounds, both eerie and ethnic,<br />\necho and fade, evanescing from<br />\none to the other without reason<br />\nand without effect.<br />\nCharitably, one might think<br />\nthat perhaps this simply wasn't<br />\nthe best choice for an opening<br />\nnumber. Unfortunately for the<br />\naudience, this is the basic model<br />\nupon which Sylvian seems to base<br />\nall his instrumentals.

So much for<br />\nthematic or stylistic continuity.<br />\nThe only thing that holds together<br />\nthe following selection is that I<br />\nlike the songs. Whether the music<br />\nis old or new, popular or obscure,<br />\n(I don't even know the titles to<br />\nsome pf these artists' albums),<br />\nchances are I'm going to like it,<br />\nso here are some of my favorites:<br />\n<br />\n1. \"Fool's Overture,\" Supertramp, Even in the Quietest of<br />\nMoments.<br />\n2. \"Family Snapshot,\" Peter<br />\nGabriel, Peter Gabriel.<br />\n<br />\nthe material and whether you can<br />\nremember which synthesizer<br />\nsound goes with which title.<br />\nThe sense of space Sylvian<br />\ndeveloped back on Tin Drum<br />\nseems to have disappeared entirely, replaced by a desire to fill<br />\nevery possible frequency with exotic aural textures. On record it<br />\nworks all right, provided you're<br />\nin the right mood. (You can<br />\nalways take it off and play<br />\nsomething different. If only we<br />\nhad that option in concert.)<br />\nSylvian has assembled quite<br />\na supporting group for his<br />\nfirst solo U.S. tour. Steve Jansen<br />\nand Richard Barbieri, on drums<br />\nand keyboards respectively, were<br />\nboth members of Japan, and they<br />\nmesh most effectively with the<br />\nrest of the band; an unnamed<br />\nguitarist and bass player.<br />\nThe stars of the group,<br />\nhowever, are trumpet/flugelhorn/soprano saxist Mark Isham,<br />\nand electric guitarist David Torn.<br />\nBoth players are well known for<br />\ntheir independent work. Isham<br />\nhas composed a number of film<br />\nscores, and Tom is currently touring (simultaneously) behind his<br />\nnewest album.<br />\nBoth musicians are seasoned<br />\nsession players, and, to the band's<br />\ndetriment, that's exactly what<br />\nthey sound like. It's not entirely<br />\ntheir fault. Sylvian arranges his<br />\nmusic to provide for solo spots<br />\nfor them and features them both<br />\nin nearly every piece.<br />\nPresumably, this is to give the<br />\naudience the notion that the band<br />\nis somehow improvising and taking chances with the material. In<br />\nthe end, though, all we notice is<br />\nthe fact that the band is follow-<br />\n<br />\ning a very strict program and that<br />\nthese four or eight bar solos are<br />\nmerely interruptions, trivial<br />\nasides to their progress. In fact,<br />\neven the solos themselves deserve<br />\nto be described in this way.<br />\nIsham, whose classical tone<br />\nand lyricism usually leave me<br />\nbreathless, sounded frustrated,<br />\nplaying in small, tight, empty<br />\ncircles. Torn fared little better.<br />\nThe primary interest in his playing was his unique tone; call it<br />\nspace-fuzz. Still, given the<br />\nlimited resources of the pieces<br />\nthey were playing, it was impossible for them to deliver<br />\nconsistently.<br />\nThe evening was not a complete loss, however. As bad as the<br />\ninstrumental selections could be,<br />\nwhen the band finally got around<br />\nto some ensemble playing as on<br />\nSylvian's vocal numbers, they<br />\nshined. \"Orpheus,\" \"Nostalgia,\"<br />\nand \"When Poets Dream<br />\nof Angels,\" songs from<br />\nhis first and third albums, all succeeded brilliantly.<br />\nThe show even included two<br />\nknock-out, standing ovation worthy performances. The first was<br />\nthe title piece to Brilliant Trees.<br />\nIt started out quiet and spare and<br />\nmoved upwards on the strength of<br />\nSylvian's liquid vocals and Barbieri's orchestral synth work. The<br />\nfinal song of the evening took<br />\nhonors, though. \"Let the Happiness In\" levitated the entire audience with its simple message,<br />\nwhile building, soaring, and gaining momentum on its way to a<br />\nmusical nirvana.

Although<br />\nshe details the sexual situation<br />\nprofusely, her attempt at<br />\nunderstanding the oppression of<br />\nthe poor in Haiti is feeble and<br />\nresembles that of any comfortable<br />\nperson who speaks of the injustices of poverty with great<br />\nmoral fervor while continuing to<br />\nparticipate in the indulgences of<br />\nthe wealthy. Kathy rationalizes,<br />\nby convincing herself that she<br />\ndoes sympathisize with the poor,<br />\nand appeases her barely present<br />\nconscience.<br />\nThe ending is pretty inconsequential. She is lured to resort to<br />\nmagic so as to sort out her life;<br />\nwhat really happens is that<br />\neveryone is just dragging money<br />\nout of her. Protests that she has<br />\nno money are overcome with just<br />\na little persistence; she does not<br />\ncare that much. The magic does<br />\nnothing for her either.<br />\nIn this way, the conclusion<br />\nfulfills the nonexistent claim of<br />\nthe title\u2014Kathy goes to Haiti, and<br />\nthat it's \u2014not Love in Haiti, or<br />\nDeath in Haiti, or least of all<br />\nBetrayal in Haiti.<br />\n<br />\nLiteral Madness: Three Novels<br />\nby Kathy Acker, Kathy Acker,<br />\n$19.95, Grove Press, January<br />\n1988, 410 pp.<br />\nby Aravinda Pillalamarri<br />\nJust what we needed, another<br />\nperson to perceive herself as<br />\na displaced Hamlet. Of course,<br />\nwe only know about her because<br />\nshe writes, but how can writing<br />\nbe the answer to her malady?<br />\nHence, Literal Madness, an exercise in inconsequentiality, in<br />\nnothingness. The three novels included in this volume are: Kathy<br />\nGoes to Haiti, first published in<br />\n1978, My Death, My Life by Pier<br />\nPaolo Pasolini, first published in<br />\n1985, and Florida, written in<br />\n1976 but not published in book<br />\nform until now.<br />\nThe sequence in which the<br />\nthree come is quite to the advantage of the reader. Like a graded<br />\nreader is to the study of a foreign<br />\nlanguage so is this book to the unconventional writing style of one<br />\nKathy Acker.<br />\nKathy Goes to Haiti<br />\n<br />\nA young woman named Kathy,<br />\nnot so surprisingly with all the<br />\nsame characteristics as the author<br />\nherself (a twenty-nine year old<br />\nwhite girl from New York, constantly believed to be much<br />\nyounger) takes a vacation to<br />\nHaiti, where she knows no one,<br />\nfor no apparent reason.<br />\nSince she is a young, white,<br />\nrich-looking and alone, everyone<br />\nwants her and nobody is subtle<br />\nabout it. Finally, she meets<br />\nRoger, and the two fall into lust<br />\nat once.<br />\nKathy is said to have no<br />\nmoney, though she keeps spending it. Above all, Kathy is gullible and spineless. She defends her<br />\nsexual activities to eleven year old<br />\nbeggars whom she befriends. She<br />\nis aware that the land belongs to<br />\nthem.<br />\nThe first thing one notices is the<br />\nway things are called in terms of<br />\ntheir function for the time. Kathy<br />\nis at times the white girl, at times<br />\nso-and-so's girlfriend, sometimes<br />\nKathy. The speakers in a conversation are rarely given, because<br />\nthe speaker or the character<br />\nshould be revealed clearly by the<br />\nspeech.<br />\nOn the other hand, if the speech<br />\ndoes not betray the speaker, then<br />\nperhaps it simply does not matter who said it. She will not clutter the speech with \"she said\"<br />\nbecause that would be too much<br />\nof a consession to the audience.<br />\nIt is the reader who must meet her<br />\nall the way.<br />\nOne exception to this when the<br />\nlovers, or lusters as she presents<br />\nthem, speak in the penultimate<br />\nchapter. Acker condescends to<br />\noffer a curt orientation of the<br />\nspeaker's identities, as one would<br />\ndo if writing a play; that is, she<br />\nwrites:<br />\nRoger: \"Hello.'<br />\nKathy: \"Uh.\"<br />\nand the dialogue continues from<br />\nthere without any comments from<br />\nthe narrator. What two lines<br />\nwould it have mattered least who<br />\nsaid which?<br />\nBut what is important here is<br />\n<br />\nMy Death, My Life by Pier<br />\nPaolo Pasolini.<br />\nThe same sense of confusion<br />\ncontinues in My Death, My Life<br />\nby Pier Paolo Pasolini in an intensified degree. Here Acker<br />\nreleases any restrictions she may<br />\nhave placed on her use of<br />\nlanguage. She changes narrators<br />\nwithout warning, at one time letting the promised Pier Paolo<br />\nPasolini tell the story, then suddenly taking over herself.<br />\n<br />\n.You may think this is of little<br />\nconsequence. Well, then, good<br />\nfor you. Notice that one narrator<br />\nis a man and one is a woman. One<br />\nthinks that it would be important<br />\nto be able to differentiate them<br />\nwhen reading because there is<br />\nhardly a moment when the narrator is not discussing or engaging in sexual activity.<br />\nIn keeping the reader unaware<br />\nof the sex of the person who is involved in sex with the man or<br />\nwoman in question (the sex of the<br />\nother is known)one begins to feel<br />\nthat it really does not matter.<br />\nThis is the prevailing sentiment<br />\nin the world Acker depicts; it<br />\nhardly matters to the characters,<br />\nnone of whom considers any sexual orientation unusual, most of<br />\nwhom are bisexual anyway. And<br />\nso Acker refuses to satisfy any<br />\ncuriosity an uninitiated reader<br />\nmay have regarding the type of<br />\nsexual activity taking place at any<br />\ngiven moment.<br />\nThis novel is much more overtly contemplative and selfreferential than the first one. In<br />\nthe first chapter we get a picture<br />\nof a murder mystery narrated by<br />\nthe murdered man, Pier Paolo<br />\nPasolini. After hearing three or<br />\nfour perspectives on the story, as<br />\none would in a courtroom from<br />\nthe witnesses and so on, one is set<br />\nup for a conventional tale of<br />\nsuspense. Even when at the end,<br />\nPasolini says:<br />\nEvery human being has intentions. Every human being is connected to every other human being and the intentionality ofthese<br />\nconnections is language. What<br />\nhappens when there is no<br />\nlanguage or when language<br />\ndoesn't mean?.. .1, Pier Paolo<br />\nPasolini, will solve my murder by<br />\ndenying the principle ofcausation<br />\nand by proposing nominalism.<br />\nWe are left with a statement that<br />\n<br />\nadheres in form to a passionate<br />\ndeclaration by a murdered man<br />\nseeking his revenge.<br />\nTo turn the page (actually, two<br />\npages she makes us turn), and see<br />\na dialogue between Ophelia and<br />\nPolonius then would be somewhat<br />\nof a shock. Upon closer inspection one sees that it is a corruption of the original, quite a corruption indeed.<br />\nIt is actually quite amusing<br />\nAcker is convincing in the way<br />\nshe rewrites their dialogues so as<br />\nto present what they were really<br />\nthinking at the time. Acker is proficient at shock. To hear the<br />\nfollowing from the voice of<br />\nRomeo, speaking to Juliet, referring to the time at which they my<br />\nhave their rendezvous, to put it<br />\nmore mildly than Juliet does in<br />\nasking for it: \"As soon as the<br />\nmorning sun has shot its sperm<br />\nover all blackness.<br />\nBarely after the prose has comfortably turned to drama, the<br />\nEnglish turns to French for a few<br />\npages. Eventually back to<br />\nEnglish, then ready for some<br />\nphilosophizing in the voice(s) of<br />\none or both of the authors about<br />\nthis great linguistic experiment<br />\nbeing undertaken at their hands.<br />\nIf an answer to nominalism is<br />\nthat the abstract quantity behind<br />\nall the words for such is a divine<br />\nforce, or God, Acker offers the<br />\nanswer that it is sex. Acker shows<br />\nthe thought of sex to be the<br />\nprimary occupant of everyone's<br />\nmind, and will derive this thought<br />\nfrom the words of anyone's<br />\nspeech.<br />\nIn this way she takes her<br />\nstream-of-consciousness to its<br />\ncompletion. In ignoring all grammatical rules she feels<br />\nsuperfluous herself, she sets an<br />\nexample in her writing.

Rather than read the<br />\nstory as an exercise unto itself,<br />\nyour friends try to find<br />\nthemselves in it by pointing out<br />\nfamiliar aspects of your<br />\ncharacters.

Reading is an<br />\nimmensely personal experience.<br />\nand having the author's life<br />\npresented as of prime importance<br />\nto an understanding of the writing<br />\nremoves the author from his or<br />\nher driver's seat. Rather than an<br />\nobject, the writing is then<br />\npresented as symptomatic and<br />\nloses importance. Instead of<br />\nallowing the writer to reveal as<br />\nthey will through story and<br />\ncharacter, it is as if the biographer<br />\nis interrupting the reader-writer<br />\ndialogue and shouting. \"What the<br />\nauthor really means is...\"<br />\n<br />\nIndeed, if art is timeless then<br />\nintimate psychological knowledge<br />\nof the author should not be vital<br />\nto its interpretation and<br />\nunderstanding.

Ontario University Gazette<br />\n(ISIS)\u2014What's in a dream'?<br />\nThis question has been asked<br />\ndown the centuries among the<br />\nlearned and the lay person<br />\nwithout much resolution. It's an<br />\nactivity that consumes a large part<br />\nof all our lives (some more than<br />\nothers) because, whether you<br />\nrealize it or not, we all dream<br />\nseveral times each night.<br />\nEach night we repeatedly progress through four stages of REM<br />\nsleep. REM, or rapid eye movement, is named after the<br />\ncharacteristic eye movements<br />\nassociated with the dreaming<br />\nphase. It gets longer with each cycle, and can last as long as 40<br />\nminutes in the final bout of<br />\ndreaming prior to awakening.<br />\nDoug Cann, a Jungian analyst<br />\nand a doctor of psychology, is<br />\none of about 10 individuals in<br />\nCanada qualified to analyze and<br />\ninterpret dreams with regard to<br />\nthe disciplines of Carl Jung.<br />\n\"The dream comes from<br />\nanother side of your personality<br />\nand I would say its primary function is to balance and compensate<br />\nthe conscious view points or attitudes towards situations, particularly when they get out of line<br />\nwith what's needed to actually<br />\nadapt and grow,\" he said.<br />\nIt's very common to awaken<br />\nand not remember dreaming.<br />\nDream recall has to do with what<br />\nstage of sleep you awakened from<br />\nsince memories of dreams are<br />\nvery transitory and are quickly<br />\nforgotten unless you awake in the<br />\nmiddle of a dream. Such interruptions can be a result of an external disturbance or from the impact of the dream jolting you to<br />\nconsciousness.<br />\n<br />\n\"Sometimes we have dreams<br />\nthat are very everyday so there<br />\nisn't a lot of salience or impact in<br />\nthat dream and so you don't<br />\nawaken with a strong memory of<br />\nit. Other times you have a<br />\nnightmare. It wakes you up; the<br />\npower of the impact is so great<br />\nyou actually are pulled out of<br />\nyour sleep. Those kinds of<br />\ndreams aren't usually too difficult<br />\nto recall,\" said Cann.<br />\n\"If you have a dream that has<br />\ncome a number of time, it's like<br />\nan insistent message, the unconsicous is saying this one is important and you need to take note of<br />\nit,\" he said with reference to the<br />\nnotion that both recurring dreams<br />\nand the relative potency of dream<br />\nimages alert to an unresolved<br />\nsituation in our lives. If the dream<br />\ndoes not interrupt the sleep cycle,<br />\nit means we have found some way<br />\nof coping with the situation.<br />\nSince it has been demonstrated<br />\nthat animals also dream, there<br />\nwould appear to be an even more<br />\nbasic need or requirement for<br />\ndreaming. As Cann explained,<br />\n\"The biological theories for the<br />\nfunction of dreaming have to do<br />\nwith the maturation of the nervous system. Before a child is<br />\nborn there is a very high proportion of time spent in REM sleep,<br />\nsomewhere around 80 percent,<br />\nand as you grow that proportion<br />\ndrops. You get a very high proportion of it in the early stages of<br />\nboth physiological and maturational development. Part of the<br />\ntheory is that it has biological<br />\nfunction in helping the brain to<br />\nlay down neural pathways in<br />\ndeveloping patterns of the perceptual organ.\"<br />\nOne of the frustrating aspects<br />\nof dreams is their lack of lucidity<br />\nand rationality.

MD Relays<br />\nby Laura Perlinn<br />\nThe women's track team opened up their 1988 season last<br />\nSaturday, April 2, with an impressive tie for second place with<br />\nWestern Maryland at the Western<br />\nMaryland Relays, the best that<br />\nHopkins has ever done at that<br />\nmeet. Hopkins scored 62 points<br />\nbehind Messiah, who had a<br />\nphenomenal 120 points (maybe<br />\nbecause it was Easter weekend)<br />\nbut ahead of MAC rivals Dickinson, Susquehanna, Juniata, and<br />\nGettysburg.<br />\nBesides their team success,<br />\nthere were numerous individual<br />\nsuccesses, as co-captain Laura<br />\nPerlinn broke the school record<br />\nin the 400 meter hurdles with a<br />\ntime of 70.6, Krista Johnson<br />\nbroke her own school record in<br />\nthe triple jump with a jump of<br />\n34'2\", and the 4 X 100 meter<br />\nrelay team of Mary Gifford,<br />\n<br />\nDiana Logan, Perlinn, and<br />\nJohnson also broke the school<br />\nrecord with a time of 52.4. As<br />\nCoach Gary Green said, \"It is<br />\nremarkable that three records got<br />\nbroken in one meet, let alone in<br />\nthe first meet of the season.\"<br />\nHopkins also qualified several<br />\nwomen to the MAC Championship meet in May, namely Perlinn<br />\nin the 400 hurdles, Johnson in the<br />\ntriple jump, the 4 X 100 and the<br />\n4 X 400 (Perlinn, Gifford,<br />\nLogan, and co-captain Suzi<br />\nMcGinn), and April Savoye in the<br />\nlong jump and the triple jump.<br />\nHopkins won only one race, the<br />\n4 X 200 of Gifford, Jean Wu,<br />\nDana Fuqua, and Johnson, when<br />\nMessiah was disqualified. Second<br />\nplaces were earned by the 4 X<br />\n100, the triple jump team of<br />\nJohnson and Savoye, and the<br />\nSprint Medley team of Fuqua,<br />\nLani Firester, Savoye, and<br />\n<br />\nLogan.<br />\nFor the distance runners, a<br />\nrelay meet is very different. First<br />\nof all, nobody could qualify for<br />\nthe MAC meet because one can't<br />\nuse relay splits as qualifying<br />\ntimes, and second, it's often hard<br />\nto pace oneself running a long<br />\nrelay leg. Still, good performances were turned in by Suzi<br />\nMcGinn in the Distance Medley<br />\nand 4 X 800, Molly Bardsley in<br />\nthe Distance Medley and the 4 X<br />\n1600. Audra Mai in the 4 X 800<br />\nand the 4 X 1600, Stephanie<br />\nSnedden in the Distance Medley<br />\nand 4 X 800, Tamsen Love in the<br />\n4 X 800 and 4 X 1600, Donya<br />\nNiedzwiedzki in the Distance<br />\nMedley, and Tracy Hourigan in<br />\nthe 4 X 1600.<br />\nBoth Coach Green and Coach<br />\nEleanor Simonsick were extremely pleased with the women's performances. \"We have a lot of<br />\n<br />\ndepth, a lot of talent, and we're<br />\nin real good shape,\" Green said.<br />\nThe team does have one weakness<br />\nthis year, however, and that is in<br />\nthe throwing events. Their one<br />\n\"weight\" woman, Sheryl Bedno,<br />\nthrew the discus well but couldn't<br />\nscore at Western Maryland by<br />\nherself. Also, because nobody is<br />\ncompeting in the shot put,javelin,<br />\nor high jump, the Lady Jays are<br />\ngoing to be at a big disadvantage<br />\nin dual and tri-meets.<br />\nThe men's team, unfortunately, didn't fare as well as the<br />\nwomen at Western Maryland,<br />\nplacing fifth overall in a field of<br />\nnine.

This year the admissions office received everything from comic strips<br />\nto a rubber stamp that says \"J.H. Admits<br />\nLen.\" One applicant came in for an interview and performed magic tricks with a<br />\ntop hat and disappearing flowers.<br />\nThe essay question this year asked the applicants to describe a humorous event from<br />\ntheir personal experiences. Schnydman's<br />\nfavorite essay was the one about the kid<br />\nwho broke the toilet seat and tried to fix<br />\nit with Super Glue. His mother used the<br />\ntoilet only moments after the accident and<br />\nwas promptly glued to the seat.<br />\nNot all applications are as memorable,<br />\nhowever, and since the admissions committee reads about forty applications a day,<br />\nthe process can become tedious. Admissions officers are forced to look for<br />\ndistinguishing features that set an applicant<br />\napart from the rest.<br />\n\"We have what we call 'Special Interest<br />\nGroups,\u2014 said India Lowres, the senior<br />\nassistant director of admissions. \"Those<br />\ninclude children of alumni, minorities,<br />\nathletes and VIPs. An applicant is a VIP<br />\nwhen an important person recommends<br />\nthem.\" Being in a special interest group,<br />\nhowever, does not guarantee admissions,<br />\nalthough it does help.<br />\nAs for athletes, some may believe that<br />\nlacrosse players will automatically gain admission, regardless of their academic<br />\nrecord. Not true, said the admissions director. \"All the students we admit, we feel<br />\ncan do the work,\" he said. \"There will<br />\nprobably be seven or eight lacrosse players<br />\ncoming in next year; that's 1.08 percent<br />\nof the applicant pool.\u2014 Schnydman himself<br />\nis a former midfielder for the Hopkins<br />\nlacrosse team in the mid 1960s.<br />\nLowres said, \"The only way we could<br />\nhave strong athletic teams is to give some<br />\nbreaks to the athletes, but not to the extent where we admit those who cannot survive here academically. Last year, for example, we rejected the number one<br />\nlacrosse recruit because we felt he did not<br />\nmeet our standards.\"<br />\nAnother characteristic that sets applicants apart from the rest include<br />\ngeographic diversity. \"We think<br /><br />\nOne<br /><br />\ngeographic diversity will bring lots of different points of view to the campus. . . added perspectives,\" said Schnydman. The applicant from Oregon, he said,<br />\nwould be favored over the applicant from<br />\nNew Jersey, all other credentials being<br />\nequal.<br />\nThis year, Hopkins will be making a<br />\nspecial effort to increase the geographic<br />\ndiversity of its students. \"For the first<br />\ntime, we'll be sending a representative on<br />\na tour of Europe,\" said Rachel Hendrickson, associate director of admissions.<br />\n\"This is our first venture abroad. Usually<br />\nforeign students seek us out because of our<br />\nreputation.\"<br />\nAnother part of the admission process<br />\nis the interview. Although it can be one of<br />\nthe most nerve-wracking experiences for<br />\ncollege applicants, the interview is only a<br />\nway to get applicants to see the school.<br />\nOnly twenty to twenty-five percent of all<br />\napplicants come for an interview, and<br />\nSchnydman said that attaching great impor-<br /><br />\nRichard A.

Thus, interviews do not have<br />\nmuch influence in whether a student is accepted to Hopkins. \"It only comes into<br />\nplay for the borderline cases,\" said<br />\nLowres.<br />\nEven after the mailing of acceptance/re-<br /><br />\nRichard A. Bell<br /><br />\nOutside the Admissions Office. For many, the beginning of life at Hopkins.<br /><br />\njection notices, however, the headaches do<br />\nnot end for the admissions staff. In the next<br />\nfew weeks, it will receive phone calls from<br />\nirate parents of students who have been<br />\nrefused admission.<br />\nLowres said, \"Most will want some<br />\ntangible reason as to why their son or<br />\ndaughter was rejected. In most cases, there<br />\nis nothing about that student that is terrible. We've turned down valedictorians<br />\nbefore because they were not competitive<br />\nenough within our applicant pool. It's a<br />\nvery hard thing to do.\"<br />\nSome parents rant and rave and even<br />\nread off a list of other colleges which have<br />\naccepted their son or daughter. Those<br />\nparents still have hope though. \"They can<br />\nalways write and ask for reconsideration,\"<br />\nsaid Hendrickson. The chances for acceptance after reconsideration, however, is<br />\nvery slim. Usually, only one applicant a<br />\nyear who is reconsidered is accepted, even<br />\nin light of new circumstances.<br />\nIn conclusion, Lowres stressed, \"We<br />\nare not a computerized office; we don't<br />\nplug the information into a computer and<br />\nexpect it to evaluate everyone.\" With<br />\nevery application read at least twice, the<br />\nprocess has a large human element.<br />\nHendrickson said, \"We [the Admissions<br />\nOffice] are only a part of the reasons why<br />\nstudents come here after they've been accepted.

Muller explained the three ways in which<br />\nthe University will attempt to<br />\nremedy the situation.<br />\nFirst, a special campaign for<br />\nArts and Sciences is being planned to raise revenue for the school.<br />\nMuller also described the<br />\nestablishment of the University<br />\nreserve fund, to which all branches of the University will<br />\ncontribute.<br />\n\"In the long run [the fund] is<br />\nnot intended to help any one division forever. . . in the short run it<br />\nwill assist Arts and Sciences,\"<br />\nsaid Muller.<br />\nFinally, Muller said it was<br />\nnecessary to reduce expenditures<br />\nwithin Arts and Sciences, and he<br />\nexplained the reasoning behind<br />\nthe five-year plan for the school<br />\nproposed by Arts and Sciences<br />\nDean Lloyd Armstrong Jr.<br />\nAccording to Muller, this plan<br />\nstipulates that the size of the Arts<br />\nand Sciences faculty is to be<br />\nreduced by ten percent\u2014about<br />\ntwenty-five faculty members\u2014<br />\nover the next five years. It also<br />\nrequires that the plans for the<br />\nrenovation of Gilman Hall and<br />\nchemistry building construction<br />\nbe delayed indefinitely.<br />\nMuller said that the reduction<br />\nwill occur largely through attrition. \"Attrition of the faculty is<br />\na marginal adjustment,\" said<br />\nMuller, who explained that the<br />\nfive-year plan will reduce the size<br />\nof the faculty from 255 to about<br />\n230\u2014the size it had been in 1982.<br />\nMuller said that the faculty<br />\nreduction will not be \"across the<br />\nboard,\" and that the administration will use this coming summer<br />\nto look more closely at ways in<br />\nwhich expenditures can be reduced.<br />\nThe construction delays, said<br />\nMuller, are necessary even<br />\nthough the work is to be funded<br />\nby the Series 1985A Revenue<br />\nbonds\u2014a package totalling $209<br />\nmillion and intended solely for<br />\nconstruction and renovation at the<br />\nHomewood campus. Muller said<br />\nthat the University can't continue<br />\nto incur debts for construction<br />\nwhile allowing Arts and Sciences<br />\nto operate with its burden.<br />\n\"If we had the ability to pay the<br />\ndebt, we have the money to do the<br />\nconstruction.\" he said.<br />\nMuller explained that new building adds expenses to the schools<br />\nbecause it adds debt to their<br />\nbudgets. \"The bond issue is not<br />\na gift, but a debt. . . if the money<br />\nis spent on Arts and Sciences,<br />\n[the school] must pay debt service.\"<br />\nMuller also commented on the<br />\ndecision regarding the successor<br />\nto Dean of Homewood Schools<br />\nAdministration Robert Welch.<br />\nThe position will be of Dean, said<br />\nMuller, except that he will report<br />\nto both academic deans of Arts<br />\nand Sciences and the G.W.C.<br />\nWhiting School of Engineering.<br />\nThe title of the new position is<br />\nDean of Student Services.<br />\nMuller described the reasons<br />\nbehind this choice of ad-<br /><br />\nministrative structure.

Reprinted<br />\nwith permission.<br />\nPart 2 of 2<br />\nAnother perennial criticism of<br />\nGreeks is that despite their professed interest in encouraging<br />\nacademic achievement, fraternity life actually impedes scholastic<br />\nperformance.<br />\nSurvey of Grades<br />\nThose criticisms are borne out<br />\npartially by a preliminary survey<br />\nissued in December by the Center<br />\nfor the Study of the College<br />\nFraternity, based in Bloomington,<br />\nInd. The survey found that in<br />\n1986, 37.1 percent of fraternity<br />\nmen polled had grade-point<br />\naverages below the national<br />\naverage for all male college<br />\nstudents. Only 22.8 percent had<br />\naverages exceeding the national<br />\nnorm.<br />\nAmong women sorority<br />\nmembers, on the other hand, 38.9<br />\npercent had grade-point averages<br />\nabove the norm for women, while<br />\nonly 19.1 percent had averages<br />\nbelow the norm.<br />\nDr. Wilder says his research on<br />\nBucknell's fraternities leads him<br />\nto conclude that fraternity life<br />\nitself is not responsible for what<br />\nhe calls \"distinctive differences\"<br />\nbetween fraternity members and<br />\nso-called independents. But he<br />\nsays the type of person who<br />\nchooses fraternity life is different<br />\nfrom the type who chooses to remain unaffiliated.<br />\n\"Fraternity members tend to<br />\nbe somewhat less intellectual,<br />\nsomewhat less academically<br />\nmotivated, and somewhat less<br />\nscholastically able,\" he says.<br />\n\"By contrast, Greeks appear to<br />\nbe probably better socially and<br />\nemotionally adjusted, more<br />\npopular, better regarded by peers.<br /><br />\nThey are the social glue that<br />\nkeeps the campus together.\"<br />\nDr. Wilder said Greeks also<br />\ntended to be more conformist and<br />\nless independent than non-Greeks<br />\nhe studied.<br />\nFor all the criticism, few are<br />\narguing that fraternities should be<br />\nabolished. A detailed 1983 study<br />\nat Stanford University laid out a<br />\nnumber of arguments in favor of<br />\nthe fraternity system. The report<br />\nof the study argued that the \"relationships formed in a fraternity or<br />\nsorority are frequently closer and<br />\nlonger lasting than the friendships<br />\nestablished elsewhere while one<br />\nis a student.\" It also said that<br />\nGreek organizations \"accelerate<br />\nsocial ease and comfort and the<br />\ndiscovery of one's common<br />\nbonds with other members of the<br />\ngroup.\"<br />\nFraternity officials interviewed<br />\nat the Dallas convention also<br />\nargued that many fraternity<br />\norganization were actively engaged in community service work,<br />\nbut that their good deeds were ignored amid accounts in the press<br />\nof drinking, hazing, and sexual<br />\nmisconduct. On many campuses,<br />\nthe officials noted, fraternities<br />\ntake the lead in fund raising efforts for a variety of causes.<br />\nAccess to Alcohol Curtailed<br />\nFraternities have also worked<br />\na deal with what many Greeks<br />\nthink is their most serious problem: alcohol abuse. Spurred in<br />\npart by tougher drinking laws, increases in liability insurance, and<br />\nthreats of litigation against fraternities and universities, many<br />\nfraternities and sororities have<br />\nbeen forced to severly curtail access to alcohol at house events.<br />\nMr. Brandt of the National<br />\nInter-Fraternity Conference said<br />\nthat almost 400 of the organization's 800 affiliated campuses had<br />\ninstituted so-called dry rushes, in<br />\nwhich alcohol is forbidden at<br /><br />\nevents for pledges.<br />\nMost fraternities say they<br />\nclosely patrol house parties to<br />\nprevent under-age drinking. At<br />\nSt. Joseph's University in<br />\nPhiladelphia, for instance, identity cards are checked ,frhen<br />\nstudents enter a fraternity party.<br />\nPeople 21 and older are given<br />\narm bands. Only those with arm<br />\nbands may drink.<br />\nSuch measures are not<br />\nfoolproof. Last fall the Pennsylvania State Liquor Control<br />\nBoard netted 350 under-age<br />\ndrinkers in a statewide sweep of<br />\ncolleges and fraternities.<br />\nSome students also argue that<br />\nthe new strictures on drinking in<br />\nfraternity houses in fact increases<br />\nthe chances of drinking-related<br />\naccidents.<br />\nAt Florida State University.<br />\nwhere the student-run InterFraternity Council last year banned most fraternity keg parties,<br />\nBarry N. Crabtree, a senior and<br />\nan official of Delta Chi, says he<br />\nhas to worry about students' driv.ing back and forth to stores to buy<br />\nand consume the alcohol they<br />\ncan't get at the fraternity house.<br />\n\"We have to be more careful<br />\nas far as the liability goes because<br />\nwe don't want people out there<br />\ndrunk on the roads killing other<br />\npeople or killing themselves,\" he<br />\nsays.<br />\nNonetheless, Mr. Crabtree and<br />\nothers say the new alcohol regulations may lead to a revitalization<br />\nof the fraternity movement. \"It<br />\nincreases the brotherhood,<br />\nbecause people aren't always<br />\nsmashed,\" he says.<br />\nAt the University of New<br />\nHampshire, where the Interfraternity Council recently started a dry<br />\nrush, Mr. Sciola, the Greek adviser, says: \"I'm confident<br />\nGreeks U.N.H. and across the<br />\ncountry will see that our founders<br />\nhad something a little different in<br />\nmind than what has been going on<br />\nin the last few years.\"<br /><br />\nATTENTION BSN<br />\nCLASS OF 1988.<br />\nThe Air Force has a special program for 1988 BSNs.

The office anticipates 735 of the 2200 applicants to<br />\nenroll; however, the actual number who attend<br />\nhas been higher in past years than the estimate.<br />\nFor Schnydman and his crew, the increased<br />\nnumber of applicants allows them to continue<br />\nto raise standards as well as diversify ethnically<br />\nand geographically. And the number of students<br />\nenrolling has been on the upswing for several<br />\nyears now. That's great news, on the one<br />\nhand. It means that Admissions is attracting<br />\nmore and more highly qualified students; in the<br />\nlong run, this can mean an increasingly competitive undergraduate atmosphere.<br />\nBut if you're going to have more kids, you've<br />\ngot to build a bigger house. And it seems like<br />\nthere are just no plans to build an addition right<br />\nnow.<br />\nFor the past three years, an increasing<br />\nnumber of freshmen have been housed offcampus in Rogers House and McCoy Hall.<br />\nWhile these have served as adequate temporary<br />\nsolutions, it is time that administrators find<br />\nsome way to provide on-campus housing for<br />\nall freshmen. Campus life at Hopkins is already<br />\nso fragmented, with nearly every student moving off-campus after freshman year; freshmen<br />\nshould be able to enjoy at least one year of true<br />\ncampus life with their classmates.<br />\nThe University has made an agreement to<br /><br />\npurchase two nearby buildings but has not yet<br />\nsaid what purpose they will serve. One of these<br />\nbuildings\u2014Ivy Hall\u2014is large apartment<br />\nbuilding but is as in need of renovation as are<br />\nRogers, McCoy and Wolman Halls. No<br />\nrenovation plans have been made for the near<br />\nfuture; it looks as if another crop of Jerry's kids<br />\nwill find home, come September, to be the rundown, inappropriate apartments of Rogers and<br />\nMcCoy.<br />\nAnd what about the academic atmosphere? Now that Dean of the School of Arts<br />\nand Sciences Lloyd Armstrong is tightening the<br />\nbelt around his departments with his five-year<br />\nplan, an ever-increasing student body would<br />\nseem only to aggravate the problem. It doesn't<br />\ntake a rocket scientist to see that more students<br />\nwill bring in more tuition dollars. This,<br />\nhowever, is only a temporary situation to a<br />\nlong-term problem. For as class sizes continue<br />\nto grow, the size of the faculty will decrease\u2014<br />\naccording to Armstrong's plan.<br />\nFurthermore, some faculty have expressed<br />\nconcern that the five-year plan will force departments to reduce expenditures by hiring fewer<br />\nteaching assistants; fewer TAs will mean reducing the number of students allowed in certain<br />\ncourses.<br />\nSo while each entering class continues to<br />\ngrow and improve, the quality of education and<br />\nstudent life is perhaps being undermined by<br />\nfinancial troubles. How long can Hopkins continue to attract the most qualified applicants if<br />\nit cannot offer them the best possible education and amenities once they arrive?<br /><br />\nA Greek Doubleheader<br />\nThe sign of strength is the ability to stand up<br />\nto pressure. The Greek system nationwide is<br />\nfeeling the strains of its own behavior. Fraternities are commiting acts which involve excessive drinking, hazing, and sexual and racial<br />\nintolerance to a degree which is disturbing to<br />\nuniversities and national fraternity organizations<br />\nalike.<br />\nIncidents have been bad enough to be concerned that universities or national organizations might be planning to hew local chapters<br />\nto preserve the system. And yet, while that has<br />\nocurred in three colleges\u2014Amherst, Colby, and<br />\nW liams\u2014many more schools are deciding instead<br />\nto take a careful look at themselves. At a time<br />\nof unprecedented interest in Greek life nationwide, it is appropriate for schools and nationals<br />\nto re-examine the Greek system and effect<br />\nchanges or discipline where it is necessary\u2014<br />\nnot to abolish Greek living.<br />\nPlausible explanations exist for why Greek<br />\nlife is experiencing such popularity. Perhaps<br />\nit is fine to be part of the establishment again,<br />\nafter the iconoclastic early 70s. Students see the<br />\nGreek system as providing social opportunity.<br />\nThe organizations as a whole provide tremendous social service to the school and community. There is enough inherently good about the<br />\nsystem to look for ways to improve it. Both<br />\nschools and national organizations need to work<br />\nwith local chapters and address intolerance<br />\nwhich tends to find fuel in fraternal<br />\norganizations.<br />\nHopkins' Greek woes are thankfully less<br />\nsevere than other incidents: there have been no<br />\ndeaths due to alcohol poisoning, nor have there<br />\nbeen explicit examples of hazing or racist activity. Nevertheless, Hopkins' recent experiences, particularly with TEP, are serious<br /><br />\nall the same.<br />\nTEP national and the dean of students' office handled the incident of sexual harassment<br />\ncommendably. The fraternity members involved deserve to be disciplined. The chapter, while<br />\nstill allowed to exist, will undergo a<br />\n\"recolonization,\" which will include interviews of the brothers by alumni and national<br />\nrepresentatvies to determine who represents the<br />\nfraternity's ideals and to weed out those who<br />\ndo not. In addition their social work will help<br />\neducate them as to the serious nature of the<br />\noffense.<br />\nThe Greek system at Hopkins is not cut down<br />\nby the incident. Because the offenders are<br />\nisolated and punished, the credibility of the<br />\nsystem is maintained; because the issue of intolerance is addressed,the system is made that<br />\nmuch stronger.<br />\nSig Ep national has acted so as not to undermine the Hopkins' Greek system as well. It has<br />\nnot closed its doors to Hopkins. It has simply<br />\nasked the present members to leave. The national hopes to reintroduce Sig Ep to Hopkins<br />\nin the future with new members and a new<br />\nattitude.<br />\nThe situation is an unfortunate one for<br />\nHopkins Sig Ep brothers. Sophomore brothers<br />\nrun a strong chance of seeing a new Sig Ep<br />\nbefore they graduate. This would be a strong<br />\nblow to that group which was just forced to go<br />\ninactive. Sig Ep national may have felt that they<br />\ncould no longer retain Hopkins' chapter within<br />\ntheir organization; however, it should still treat<br />\nthe individuals with the respect they have for<br />\nthe system. For the sake of those brothers, national Sig Ep should make no efforts to bring<br />\nSig Ep back to Hopkins until after the present<br />\nstudents have all moved on.<br /><br />\nA Little Leeway<br /><br />\nTall Steps<br />\nby A. Lee Davis<br />\nIf the blossoms adorning<br />\nHomewood show a bright mauve,<br />\nand you have a baby, and a carriage to put her in, there's really<br />\nno excuse not to go for a stroll.<br />\nI had a few errands I had to do<br />\non campus, so on Tuesday, I put<br />\nHannah in her pink jumper, rolled on her pink socks, wrapped<br />\nher in her pink blanket, then placed her into her super delux carriage. When I say deluxe, I mean<br />\nit. This is the carriage 007<br />\ndreamed about when he was still<br />\njust a decimal. One button activates the bullet-proof dome,<br />\nanother fires the heat-seeking<br />\nmissies, and a third emits an oil<br />\nslick to do in any would-be pursuer. I slipped on the Wayfarers,<br />\nand informed Hannah of our mission: trips to Maryland Hall, the<br />\nSAC office, the cashier's office.<br />\nthe bookstore. We synchronized<br />\nour watches at 9:45. I had to be<br />\non the steps of Gilman by 11 for<br />\nan oral exam.<br />\nAs the carriage and I entered<br />\nthe elevator, my mood suddenly<br />\nchanged. I thought of a column!<br />\nonce intended to write, which involved obtaining a wheelchair<br />\nfrom Wyman Park and seeing<br />\nhow easily I could get from class<br />\nto class. I decided that Hannah's<br />\nrather unwieldy carriage would<br />\nshow me just how accessible this<br />\ncampus is.<br />\nGetting out of McCoy was no<br />\nproblem. There's a ramp leading<br />\ndown the steps. Out we went into the bright Baltimore sunshine.<br />\nMy first stop was Maryland Hall.<br /><br />\nI walked up the campus entranceway, navigated the curbs,<br />\nthen bore left along the tarred<br />\nsidewalk. I got to the top of the<br />\nhill, beside the Barnstormer's<br />\nbuilding, and realized I needed to<br />\nseek an alternate route; the stairs<br />\nwere too steep, the hill too bumpy. I considered my options. I<br />\ncould go back the way I came,<br />\nhead down Charles, then back up<br />\nbehind the powerplant. Or I could<br />\ngo right, circle around MSE, and<br />\nscoot back down the inter-quad<br />\nsteps. I opted for the latter course<br />\nof action. Things went smoothly<br />\nuntil I got to the steps and faced<br />\nthe inevitable folly of my choice.<br />\nBeing able to walk down steps is<br />\na hard habit to get out of.<br />\nAgain I faced a decision. I<br />\ncould go into Rowland and take<br />\nthe elevator down to the bottom<br />\nquad level, or I could go to<br />\nGilman and take that elevator. I<br />\nhad learned from my first choice<br />\nto plan out my route. I couldn't<br />\ntake the Rowland elevator,<br />\nbecause as soon as I walked in the<br />\ndoor I was faced with a sneering<br />\nrow of steps. Besides, once! had<br />\ntaken the elevator down, I'd still<br />\nhave had to walk up another short<br />\nflight to get to Maryland.<br />\nI strolled to Gilman. On my<br />\nway I passed one of our injured<br />\nathletes on crutches, huffing as he<br />\nhopped up the inter-quad steps.<br />\nHe didn't have it so bad. At least<br />\nhe could hop. I arrived at Gilman,<br />\nbut what was I to do? I couldn't<br />\njust zoom up the steps under the<br />\nclock tower, and the stairways to<br /><br />\nSee LEEWAY, 12<br /><br />\nThe Hopkins<br /><br />\nNews-Letter<br />\nEditors<br />\nBrad Handler, Elizabeth Harrigan<br />\nBusiness Managers<br />\nJulie Levine, Flory Ware<br />\nManaging Editor<br />\nGlen Weiss<br />\nProduction Managers<br />\nAnn Ginsberg, Diana Zeiger<br />\nLayout Editor<br />\nEly Brown<br />\nNews Editors<br />\nKathleen McCarthy, Jonathan Stempel<br />\nArts Editors<br />\nPhil Gochenour, Mark W.

While I agree that the<br />\nproblems that some universities<br />\nare having with some fraternities<br /><br />\non their campuses should be<br />\npublicized, I believe that running<br />\nsuch an article without running a<br />\ncorresponding article which<br />\ndiscusses the benefits and positive<br />\naspects of fraternity behavior is<br />\nnot only misleading but also unfair to fraternities and sororities,<br />\nin particular those situated on this<br />\ncampus. Articles such as the one<br />\nrun last week present a disturbing picture of fraternities to facul-<br /><br />\nA Balto. Spring<br />\n1\u201d, Eric Ruck<br />\nAh, springtime in Baltimore. I<br />\ndon't know about you, but I'm<br />\nhappy that we are approaching<br />\nthe final countdown of weeks and<br />\ndays, because with the mild<br />\nweather here it's awfully difficult<br />\nto work. Right now I'm trying to<br />\nfigure out a way to lower my<br />\nword processor out my window<br />\nSO I can finish writing this article<br />\noutside. I guess there is one advantage to using pencil and paper<br />\nafter all.<br />\nI do have one recommendation.<br />\nEven though we do not have an<br />\noutdoor pool here at Hopkins, I<br />\nwould not recommend swimming<br />\nin the harbor, unless of course<br />\nyou can swim wearing the appropriate protective gear. If you<br />\nthink walking on water is difficult, I'd check out Fells Point.<br />\nBut so long as you remain dry,<br />\nthe harbor is a good place to go<br />\nin the spring. Aside from all the<br />\nnice, touristy shopping areas,<br />\nthey frequently have live entertainment and always have a nice<br />\nbreeze from the water. And best<br />\nof all, you can go ride the antique merry-go-round.<br />\nYes, it's spring, and it's nice to<br />\nsee birds aplenty again. They<br />\nmake terrible house pets, as they<br />\nare rather noisy and dirty, and<br />\nthey never want to be adorable<br />\nwhen you have time for them to<br />\nbe adorable. I envy them,<br /><br />\nalthough not because they fly or<br />\neven because they don't have<br />\nfinals looming over their<br />\nfeathered heads. But whenever I<br />\ngo outside there they are chasing<br />\neach other around, doing quite a<br />\nbit of chirping while they're at it.<br />\nWe all know what they're doing,<br />\nright'? If not, you've been hitting<br />\nthe textbooks too hard.<br />\nOf course not all birds are<br />\nperfect. Take the Orioles, for example. For those of you who<br />\ndon't follow local sports, the<br />\nOrioles aren't quite the team they<br />\nwere in 1983. In their opening<br />\ngame against the Milwaukee,<br />\nthey lost by, oh, twelve runs,<br />\nwith a final score of about twelve<br />\nto zero. Renaming the team \"The<br />\nBaltimore Lame Ducks\" is the<br />\nfirst thing that comes to mind if<br />\nwe were to stick with the bird<br />\nmotif.<br />\nHopkins must be a good place<br />\nfor the birds and the bees. Last<br />\nMonday an ABC film crew sat by<br />\nthe sports fields on University. If<br />\nyou didn't see them, it's too late,<br />\nas they were only here for one<br />\nday. What a shame it is, too, for<br />\nthey were shooting for a new<br />\nABC pilot called Men. Johns<br />\nHopkins must be the perfect setting for this national production.<br />\nWith such location work, this one<br />\nmust get the network out of their<br />\nratings slump. As I have said<br />\nbefore, Baltimore really is a happening town.<br /><br />\nty, administration, and Baltimore<br />\ncommunity\u2014a picture which is<br />\nnot necessarily an accurate one.<br />\nAt a time when fraternities are<br />\ncoming under fire, it is especially necessary to publicize the good<br />\naspects of fraternities\u2014the things<br />\nthey do right\u2014and not give opponents of fraternities additional<br />\nfire against them.<br />\nJust a few facts. . . my sorority, Phi Mu, is deeply committed<br />\nto providing services to this campus as well as to local and national charity organizations. Annually. Phi Mu sponsors a Pastathon, a spaghetti dinner held to<br />\nraise money for the Johns<br />\nHopkins Childrens Center and the<br />\nChildren's Miracle Network. By<br />\nworking with community<br />\nbusinesses, we were able to raise<br />\nover $1,500 last year\u2014this year's<br />\ndinner, to be held April 29th,<br />\npromises to raise even more. We<br />\nalso annually raise money for<br />\nProject Hope, an organization<br />\nwhich supplies medical supplies<br />\nto third world and developing nations. We visit nursing homes,<br />\nchildrens hospitals, and are currently in the process of adopting<br />\na child in Brazil. This year, in<br />\nconjunction with Alpha Phi, we<br />\nplanned and sponsored a sexual<br />\nharrassment seminar for the<br />\nfreshman class. We partcipate in<br />\nalmost all other charity related activities, including the Phi Psi 500,<br />\nthe fundraiser for SAMS, and a<br />\ndrug awareness day for the<br />\nHopkins community,just to name<br />\na few.<br />\nBut my purpose is not to blow<br />\nPhi Mu's horn. . . all of the fraternitieis on this campus have actively been trying to become more involved with such beneficial projects as the ones mentioned<br />\nabove. The IFC, with trememdous support from the administration, has sought to make the<br />\nGreek system more cohesive and<br />\nrecognized as a positive organization. IFC events have included<br />\nco-sponsoring of the Dance<br />\nMarathon, which raised money<br /><br />\nTom'<br /><br />\ntoor<br />\nitis)t<br />\ni?<br /><br />\nTHE CIPMES OF THE<br /><br />\nSum, AFic.4N 6evEkrimEti7:<br /><br />\nPKINS Ic<br /><br />\nAAIY flPETENZ To \u2022THE GoNVARY grOffs- 77E yot4/6<br />\nTAkgrEE AS 1Yelai cf WE<br />\n,<br />\n471<br />\n.5-77Z/F.tri6; FAls-cisr<br /><br />\n1,4w,<br />\nAnSocure0 CoRkEc1:<br />\nIll6elf3AUS AT MY<br /><br />\nPace.<br /><br />\n.<br />\n,<br /><br />\n0,<br />\nyr. \u2022\u2018,<br />\nt,%-40<br /><br />\n\"<br /><br />\nuasoN sautvf Kq<br /><br />\nWEI4 11A/CESS7-#64:5 Amt /AY omeR<br />\n649AUCAITS, nitS- /1C4149iY<br />\nOF TYE 7-4,usrEes or<br /><br />\nAvosE TNE floARD 7/iff<br />\nIt&amp; F--/NDs ITS aFel.W To<br />\n- re,44 SbUTAI Afieo<br />\n12/ITS1<br />\nto6 A o/C6usroi&amp;<br />\nADMissioN oF ampfticoy<br /><br />\npasoiD satCg qpin<br /><br />\nso', VIE YoUN6 Zetiatt ads/ifs<br /><br />\nfor SAMS, and recently an Easter<br />\nEgg Hunt for children of the<br />\nfaculty, administration, and<br />\nneighbors of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nIn short, there are many<br />\npositive and beneficial projects<br />\nthe IFC, and all of the fraternities<br />\non this campus, have undertaken.<br />\nTo run an article publicizing the<br />\nproblems other schools have encountered without explaining that<br />\nHopkins fraternities are making<br />\ngreat strides, does an injustice not<br />\nonly to the Greek system at<br />\nHopkins. but also to the student<br />\nbody and many organizations<br />\nwhich benefit socially and<br />\ncharitably from the existence of<br />\nfraternities on this campus.<br />\nMary E.

Much to my surprise and to several of my<br />\nfriends', FAF's were due last Friday. What a stroke of genius! By<br />\nbarely publicizing the deadline<br /><br />\nfor the FAF, the funds the university saves from all the people who<br />\nmissed the deadline can go to correcting the deficit.<br />\nOkay, the theory is ludicrous.<br />\nHowever, the implications of<br />\npeople missing the deadline are<br />\nnot. Without financial aid quite a<br />\nnumber of people at Hopkins are<br />\nplaced in jeopardy. That, of<br />\ncourse, was an extremely obvious<br />\nstatement but one wonders what<br />\nwas on the minds of those in<br /><br />\nFinancial Aid. So,just as a footnote to all those who haven't<br />\nheard, FAF's were due April 1st<br />\nand the Hopkins Supplemental<br />\nFinancial Aid Application with<br />\nsupporting documents need to be<br />\nturned in by April 19th.

At apparently random<br />\nintervals, library security has asked to check my bag going into the<br />\nlibrary. In the past days of bomb<br />\nthreats O.K., but why today? I<br /><br />\nA Little More Leeway<br />\nLEEWAY, from 10<br />\nthe left and the right split up and<br />\ndown in their circular gyrations.<br />\nI had made a mistake at the very<br />\nstart.<br />\nI spun on my heels, pushed the<br />\ncarriage all the way back down<br />\nCharles, behind the powerplant,<br />\nand up to the lower quad. I passed Shriver and laughed to myself:<br />\nit's too bad every building didn't<br />\nhave a ramp, albeit a gratuitous<br />\none. Next door, I comtemplated<br />\nMaryland Hall. It had always<br />\nbeen a friendly building to me, in<br />\nspite of the unsatisfactory grades<br />\nI received there.<br />\nBut as I peered through the<br />\nwindows at the steps that prohibited my entrance, it seemed<br />\nvery cold. Maryland would wait,<br />\nI said to Hannah, and moved<br />\ntowards Merryman to see if a<br />\nreimbursement had come in.<br />\nIt wasn't my day, as again, a<br />\nsteep set of stairs prevented me<br /><br />\nfrom descending into the basement of the building. It was approaching 11, so the SAC office<br />\nalso had to wait. But I still had to<br />\ngo to the bookstore. I walked to<br />\nGilman the way I usually do, past<br />\nthe Glass Pavilion, towards the<br />\nEasy Bank entrance. I couldn't go<br />\nup those stairs though, so I had<br />\nto take the path to the left behind<br />\nthe building, underneath the windows of the Hut. Surprise, surprise: the only thing the path led<br />\nto was more steps. I worked my<br />\nway behind the shrubbery, and at<br />\nlast entered the bottom floor of<br />\nGilman.<br />\nI hoped things were now going<br />\nto get easier, but when I saw the<br />\nfamiliar turnstile at the bottom of<br />\nthe familiar steps, I knew I was<br />\nonce again in trouble. But I had<br />\nto get my book, so I lifted the carriage up and carried it down the<br />\nstairs. I squeezed out some blood<br />\nfor Barnes &amp; Noble, then left the<br />\nway I had come in.<br /><br />\nThe clock rang eleven. I had to<br />\nget upstairs. There was an<br />\nelevator. I knew, so I rung<br />\naround the rosie until I found it<br />\nnear the northern corner of tue<br />\nbuilding. I anxiously pressed the<br />\nbutton. I couldn't be late. I exited<br />\nthe sliding doors, went down the<br />\nramps into the coffee shop area,<br />\nand prepared to leave. Again<br />\nmore steps. How ironic: with<br />\ndoorways all around me, I was utterly trapped. I went back up the<br />\nramp to a corner stairway, lifted<br />\nthe carriage up and carried it<br />\ndown the stairs out onto the steps<br />\nof Gilman, where I was to meet<br />\nmy T.A.<br />\nThe test went well, but as I<br />\nwalked back I knew I had<br />\ncheated\u2014not on the exam, but on<br />\nthe little experiment I had decided to undertake. Who could<br />\nblame me? After all, I was tired<br />\nfrom my efforts, frustrated at my<br />\ninability to get where I had to go,<br />\nforced into tardiness by my cir-<br /><br />\ncumlocutions through campus. I<br />\nknew I wouldn't be able to handle this day after day. After all,<br />\nwhen you're in a wheelchair, you<br />\ncan't just decide you've had<br />\nenough, as I did, when faced with<br />\nyet another set of stairs. You<br />\ncan't just say \"Oh, well,\" hop<br />\nout of the chair, and carry it down<br />\nthe steps the way I carried the<br />\ncarriage. A statement as innocuous as \"meet me on the steps<br />\nof Gilman\" can be a sentence to<br />\nhard labor.<br />\nI tried to recall seeing anyone<br />\nwho was confined to a wheelchair<br />\non campus. There was a guy from<br />\nfreshman year, a real nice kid. He<br />\ntransferred\u2014if I remember<br />\ncorrectly\u2014before<br />\nthe semester was even out. As I<br />\npushed the carriage homeward, I<br />\nwondered why he left Hopkins,<br />\nbut since I couldn't remember his<br />\nname or what school he transferred to, I'd never know.<br /><br />\nunderstand that food attracts insects, and insects damage books,<br />\nso the idea is to keep the food out<br />\nof the library. Fine. But does random harassment accomplish this?<br />\nSigns are posted throughout the<br />\nlibrary so that anyone who can<br />\nread knows that food is forbidden. Apparently the MSE has no<br />\nfaith in the student body.<br />\nPerhaps I wouldn't be as annoyed if the searches weren't so<br />\npointless and inconsistently administered. Some guards simply<br />\nneed an ID. Others request us to<br />\nopen our bag, but usually don't<br />\neven look inside! WHY<br />\nBOTHER!! Also if I was intent<br />\non bringing food into the library,<br />\nI could simply stick some in a<br />\npocket and none would be the<br />\nwiser. The whole ordeal is an annoyance, an insulting violation of<br />\nprivacy based on a lack of trust.<br />\nA better solution would be to provide a STUDY LOUNGE<br />\nWHERE FOOD IS ALLOWED!! Yes, the freshmen have the<br />\nAMR I lounge, but it is usually<br />\ncrowded, and where does this<br />\nleave the upperclassmen? In our<br />\ndays of budget woes, this hardly<br />\nseems like a priority, but can the<br />\nadministration at least give this a<br />\nthought? If nothing else, we could<br />\nend the useless incoming bookbag<br />\nsearches. Let's act on this now.<br />\nI hear there are plans for strip<br />\nsearches in the cafeteria next<br />\nyear; target: salt shakers and<br />\nsilverware..<br />\nGlenn T.

He will<br />\nbe one of two Americans on an<br />\ninternational expedition which is<br />\npart of Operation Raleigh, a fouryear program started by Prince<br />\nCharles of Britain in 1984.<br />\nAs Prince Charles writes in a<br />\nstatement about the project, \"The<br />\ntheme of Operation Raleigh is<br />\nscience and service.<br />\n\"Young men and women from<br />\nvastly different backgrounds will<br />\nwork together on. . . projects set<br />\nup by multinational teams of experienced explorers and scientists, in unfamiliar places and<br />\noften under conditions of<br />\nhardship.<br />\n\"As well as making some practical contribution to a better<br />\nworld, they may grow to respect<br />\neach others' cultures and attitudes<br />\nand thus help to break some of the<br /><br />\n/\".<br /><br />\n87' Grad Scott McNamee, who (hopefully) will be mapping the uncharted Canadian Arctic this summer.<br />\nbarriers of prejudice and intolerance which have always existed. but which seem to be even<br />\nmore obvious in today's world.\"<br />\nTo date Operation Raleigh has<br />\nhelped with cataract operations in<br />\nSouth America, found ancient<br />\ncave art in Australia, and worked on other civic and scientific<br />\nprojects in 32 different countries.<br />\nThe program confronts its venturers, aged 17 to 24, with four<br />\nchallenges: the selection process,<br />\nthe problem of raising $5500 tui-,<br />\nlion, the expedition itself, and the<br />\ncompletion of 300 hours of com-<br /><br />\nmunity service upon their return.<br />\nMcNamee met the first<br />\nchallenge when he put in his application and was invited to a<br />\n\"selection weekend\" with 17<br />\nother prospective venturers. The<br />\napplicants went camping with<br />\nprogram staff, who gave them<br />\n\"hard work, little sleep, and less<br />\nfood,\" McNamee says, \"to see<br />\nwho could cope with the harsh<br />\nconditions you often find on expedition.\u2014 He did well enough to<br />\nbe chosen as one of the venturers.<br />\nHe is still working on his second challenge, which is to raise<br /><br />\nexpedition itself. 24 venturers<br />\nfrom 12 different countries will<br />\nspend the summer canoeing 600<br />\nmiles up the Kazan River in the<br />\nKeewatin District of the Northwest Territory of Canada. This<br />\narea has never been mapped<br />\nbefore except by air. The venturers will make the first groundbased maps of the region, collect<br />\npermafrost samples for scientific<br />\nstudy, catalog archeological sites,<br />\nand take several wildlife surveys.<br />\nThey will note all the wildlife<br />\nthey see in a general survey and<br />\ntake special counts of nesting<br />\nbirds and arctic wolves. When the<br />\nexpedition reaches Baker Lake in<br />\nmid-August, its members will<br />\nspend two weeks with an Inuit<br />\nEskimo tribe.<br />\nThe trip will be dangerous as<br />\nwell as exciting. In the bitter cold,<br />\nan overturned canoe could be a<br />\nlife-or-death situation. Animals<br />\npose another danger, though<br />\nMcNamee does admit he hopes<br />\nthey'll see a bear just as long as<br />\nhe's had his share to eat first!\"<br />\nThe group's only contact with the<br />\noutside world will be via shortwave radio, so McNamee is learning to use one in preparation for<br />\nhis trip. He is also working to improve his physical condition, by<br />\nrunning and lifting weights.<br />\nMcNamee looks forward to the<br />\nfourth challenge, 300 hours of<br />\ncommunity service. He has<br />\nalways enjoyed volunteer work,<br />\nand says he thinks of this task as<br />\na way of thanking the community that make his going possible.<br />\nHis own sense of community will<br />\ngrow as he lives and works with<br />\nthe Eskimoes and with his fellow<br />\nventurers.<br /><br />\n$5500 by April 15.

Stewart<br />\nPerhaps more than any other<br />\ncomposer of the punk age, David<br />\nSylvian has succeeded in<br />\ntranscending the restrictions of<br />\nhis origins to create music that is<br />\nboth original and compelling. His<br />\nfirst band, Japan, got their start<br />\nplaying embarrassingly bad glamrock, complete with make-up,<br />\nflares, and platform shoes. They<br />\ncalled their first album, Adolescent Sex. Fortunately, they stuck<br />\nwith it and later albums such as<br />\nGentlemen Take Polaroids and<br />\nTin Drum revealed an almost entirely different band, one that had<br />\ndiscovered the ideas of space and<br />\nsubtlety. They still took their cues<br />\nfrom some other bands (Roxy<br />\nMusic with their understated<br /><br />\nmusical sensibility, in particular),<br />\nbut they were on their way to<br />\nsomething entirely new, and<br />\nDavid Sylvian was leading them.<br />\nSylvian's first solo album after<br />\nJapan split up was called Brilliant<br />\nTrees and it was primarily a continuation of the work he had<br />\nstarted with Japan. By his second<br />\nalbum, Gone to Earth an expansive two record set, however,<br />\nSylvian began to reach farther,<br />\nand his ambition got the better of<br />\nhim on more than a few occasions. Split between instrumentals<br />\nand vocal pieces, the album<br />\npresents the same musical<br />\ndichotomy presented at Sylvian's Wednesday night \"In<br />\nPraise Of Shamens\" concert\u2014<br />\nlong and directionless or concise<br />\nand poetic.<br /><br />\nRight from the opening instrumental, \"Words with the<br />\nShaman: Incantations\" you know<br />\nthat you are not in for a night of<br />\nexcitement. Rythmically, the<br />\npiece begins slowly and proceeds<br />\nin funeral march fashion until it<br />\nreaches its stopping point. There<br />\nis no melodic development either.<br />\nSounds, both eerie and ethnic,<br />\necho and fade, evanescing from<br />\none to the other without reason<br />\nand without effect.<br />\nCharitably, one might think<br />\nthat perhaps this simply wasn't<br />\nthe best choice for an opening<br />\nnumber. Unfortunately for the<br />\naudience, this is the basic model<br />\nupon which Sylvian seems to base<br />\nall his instrumentals.

They<br />\nwere important because, in a<br />\nworld of Mr. Misters, Dokkens,<br />\nand Madonnas, they were among<br />\nthis decade's most melodic, affecting, and sensitive songwriters.<br />\nTheir breakup late last year is<br />\nlamentable for what has been left<br />\nin its wake.<br />\nViva Hate, the first solo effort<br />\nby former Smiths singer Stephen<br />\nMorrissey, is a more than competent, but rarely compelling,<br />\ncollection of songs whose fleeting<br />\nbrilliance only hints at its author's<br /><br />\nformer halcyon days.

So much for<br />\nthematic or stylistic continuity.<br />\nThe only thing that holds together<br />\nthe following selection is that I<br />\nlike the songs. Whether the music<br />\nis old or new, popular or obscure,<br />\n(I don't even know the titles to<br />\nsome pf these artists' albums),<br />\nchances are I'm going to like it,<br />\nso here are some of my favorites:<br /><br />\n1. \"Fool's Overture,\" Supertramp, Even in the Quietest of<br />\nMoments.<br />\n2. \"Family Snapshot,\" Peter<br />\nGabriel, Peter Gabriel.<br /><br />\nthe material and whether you can<br />\nremember which synthesizer<br />\nsound goes with which title.<br />\nThe sense of space Sylvian<br />\ndeveloped back on Tin Drum<br />\nseems to have disappeared entirely, replaced by a desire to fill<br />\nevery possible frequency with exotic aural textures. On record it<br />\nworks all right, provided you're<br />\nin the right mood. (You can<br />\nalways take it off and play<br />\nsomething different. If only we<br />\nhad that option in concert.)<br />\nSylvian has assembled quite<br />\na supporting group for his<br />\nfirst solo U.S. tour. Steve Jansen<br />\nand Richard Barbieri, on drums<br />\nand keyboards respectively, were<br />\nboth members of Japan, and they<br />\nmesh most effectively with the<br />\nrest of the band; an unnamed<br />\nguitarist and bass player.<br />\nThe stars of the group,<br />\nhowever, are trumpet/flugelhorn/soprano saxist Mark Isham,<br />\nand electric guitarist David Torn.<br />\nBoth players are well known for<br />\ntheir independent work. Isham<br />\nhas composed a number of film<br />\nscores, and Tom is currently touring (simultaneously) behind his<br />\nnewest album.<br />\nBoth musicians are seasoned<br />\nsession players, and, to the band's<br />\ndetriment, that's exactly what<br />\nthey sound like. It's not entirely<br />\ntheir fault. Sylvian arranges his<br />\nmusic to provide for solo spots<br />\nfor them and features them both<br />\nin nearly every piece.<br />\nPresumably, this is to give the<br />\naudience the notion that the band<br />\nis somehow improvising and taking chances with the material. In<br />\nthe end, though, all we notice is<br />\nthe fact that the band is follow-<br /><br />\ning a very strict program and that<br />\nthese four or eight bar solos are<br />\nmerely interruptions, trivial<br />\nasides to their progress. In fact,<br />\neven the solos themselves deserve<br />\nto be described in this way.<br />\nIsham, whose classical tone<br />\nand lyricism usually leave me<br />\nbreathless, sounded frustrated,<br />\nplaying in small, tight, empty<br />\ncircles. Torn fared little better.<br />\nThe primary interest in his playing was his unique tone; call it<br />\nspace-fuzz. Still, given the<br />\nlimited resources of the pieces<br />\nthey were playing, it was impossible for them to deliver<br />\nconsistently.<br />\nThe evening was not a complete loss, however. As bad as the<br />\ninstrumental selections could be,<br />\nwhen the band finally got around<br />\nto some ensemble playing as on<br />\nSylvian's vocal numbers, they<br />\nshined. \"Orpheus,\" \"Nostalgia,\"<br />\nand \"When Poets Dream<br />\nof Angels,\" songs from<br />\nhis first and third albums, all succeeded brilliantly.<br />\nThe show even included two<br />\nknock-out, standing ovation worthy performances. The first was<br />\nthe title piece to Brilliant Trees.<br />\nIt started out quiet and spare and<br />\nmoved upwards on the strength of<br />\nSylvian's liquid vocals and Barbieri's orchestral synth work. The<br />\nfinal song of the evening took<br />\nhonors, though. \"Let the Happiness In\" levitated the entire audience with its simple message,<br />\nwhile building, soaring, and gaining momentum on its way to a<br />\nmusical nirvana.

Although<br />\nshe details the sexual situation<br />\nprofusely, her attempt at<br />\nunderstanding the oppression of<br />\nthe poor in Haiti is feeble and<br />\nresembles that of any comfortable<br />\nperson who speaks of the injustices of poverty with great<br />\nmoral fervor while continuing to<br />\nparticipate in the indulgences of<br />\nthe wealthy. Kathy rationalizes,<br />\nby convincing herself that she<br />\ndoes sympathisize with the poor,<br />\nand appeases her barely present<br />\nconscience.<br />\nThe ending is pretty inconsequential.

The speakers in a conversation are rarely given, because<br />\nthe speaker or the character<br />\nshould be revealed clearly by the<br />\nspeech.<br />\nOn the other hand, if the speech<br />\ndoes not betray the speaker, then<br />\nperhaps it simply does not matter who said it. She will not clutter the speech with \"she said\"<br />\nbecause that would be too much<br />\nof a consession to the audience.<br />\nIt is the reader who must meet her<br />\nall the way.<br />\nOne exception to this when the<br />\nlovers, or lusters as she presents<br />\nthem, speak in the penultimate<br />\nchapter. Acker condescends to<br />\noffer a curt orientation of the<br />\nspeaker's identities, as one would<br />\ndo if writing a play; that is, she<br />\nwrites:<br />\nRoger: \"Hello.'<br />\nKathy: \"Uh.\"<br />\nand the dialogue continues from<br />\nthere without any comments from<br />\nthe narrator.

Here Acker<br />\nreleases any restrictions she may<br />\nhave placed on her use of<br />\nlanguage. She changes narrators<br />\nwithout warning, at one time letting the promised Pier Paolo<br />\nPasolini tell the story, then suddenly taking over herself.<br /><br />\n.You may think this is of little<br />\nconsequence. Well, then, good<br />\nfor you. Notice that one narrator<br />\nis a man and one is a woman. One<br />\nthinks that it would be important<br />\nto be able to differentiate them<br />\nwhen reading because there is<br />\nhardly a moment when the narrator is not discussing or engaging in sexual activity.<br />\nIn keeping the reader unaware<br />\nof the sex of the person who is involved in sex with the man or<br />\nwoman in question (the sex of the<br />\nother is known)one begins to feel<br />\nthat it really does not matter.<br />\nThis is the prevailing sentiment<br />\nin the world Acker depicts; it<br />\nhardly matters to the characters,<br />\nnone of whom considers any sexual orientation unusual, most of<br />\nwhom are bisexual anyway. And<br />\nso Acker refuses to satisfy any<br />\ncuriosity an uninitiated reader<br />\nmay have regarding the type of<br />\nsexual activity taking place at any<br />\ngiven moment.<br />\nThis novel is much more overtly contemplative and selfreferential than the first one. In<br />\nthe first chapter we get a picture<br />\nof a murder mystery narrated by<br />\nthe murdered man, Pier Paolo<br />\nPasolini. After hearing three or<br />\nfour perspectives on the story, as<br />\none would in a courtroom from<br />\nthe witnesses and so on, one is set<br />\nup for a conventional tale of<br />\nsuspense. Even when at the end,<br />\nPasolini says:<br />\nEvery human being has intentions. Every human being is connected to every other human being and the intentionality ofthese<br />\nconnections is language. What<br />\nhappens when there is no<br />\nlanguage or when language<br />\ndoesn't mean?.. .1, Pier Paolo<br />\nPasolini, will solve my murder by<br />\ndenying the principle ofcausation<br />\nand by proposing nominalism.<br />\nWe are left with a statement that<br /><br />\nadheres in form to a passionate<br />\ndeclaration by a murdered man<br />\nseeking his revenge.<br />\nTo turn the page (actually, two<br />\npages she makes us turn), and see<br />\na dialogue between Ophelia and<br />\nPolonius then would be somewhat<br />\nof a shock. Upon closer inspection one sees that it is a corruption of the original, quite a corruption indeed.<br />\nIt is actually quite amusing<br />\nAcker is convincing in the way<br />\nshe rewrites their dialogues so as<br />\nto present what they were really<br />\nthinking at the time. Acker is proficient at shock. To hear the<br />\nfollowing from the voice of<br />\nRomeo, speaking to Juliet, referring to the time at which they my<br />\nhave their rendezvous, to put it<br />\nmore mildly than Juliet does in<br />\nasking for it: \"As soon as the<br />\nmorning sun has shot its sperm<br />\nover all blackness.<br />\nBarely after the prose has comfortably turned to drama, the<br />\nEnglish turns to French for a few<br />\npages.

Acker shows<br />\nthe thought of sex to be the<br />\nprimary occupant of everyone's<br />\nmind, and will derive this thought<br />\nfrom the words of anyone's<br />\nspeech.<br />\nIn this way she takes her<br />\nstream-of-consciousness to its<br />\ncompletion.

Imagine that you have written a story and shown it to your<br />\nfriends. Rather than read the<br />\nstory as an exercise unto itself,<br />\nyour friends try to find<br />\nthemselves in it by pointing out<br />\nfamiliar aspects of your<br />\ncharacters. Suddenly, the story as<br />\nit is presented is no longer the<br />\nprimary interest but rather the<br />\nassumed integration of life with<br />\nfiction and the newly created<br />\nworld becomes a sideshow.<br />\nJust as importantly, having the<br />\npsychological aspects of a book's<br />\nnarration pointed out in gory<br />\ndetail can violate the writerreader dialogue. Reading is an<br />\nimmensely personal experience.<br />\nand having the author's life<br />\npresented as of prime importance<br />\nto an understanding of the writing<br />\nremoves the author from his or<br />\nher driver's seat. Rather than an<br />\nobject, the writing is then<br />\npresented as symptomatic and<br />\nloses importance. Instead of<br />\nallowing the writer to reveal as<br />\nthey will through story and<br />\ncharacter, it is as if the biographer<br />\nis interrupting the reader-writer<br />\ndialogue and shouting. \"What the<br />\nauthor really means is...\"<br /><br />\nIndeed, if art is timeless then<br />\nintimate psychological knowledge<br />\nof the author should not be vital<br />\nto its interpretation and<br />\nunderstanding.

Ontario University Gazette<br />\n(ISIS)\u2014What's in a dream'?<br />\nThis question has been asked<br />\ndown the centuries among the<br />\nlearned and the lay person<br />\nwithout much resolution. It's an<br />\nactivity that consumes a large part<br />\nof all our lives (some more than<br />\nothers) because, whether you<br />\nrealize it or not, we all dream<br />\nseveral times each night.<br />\nEach night we repeatedly progress through four stages of REM<br />\nsleep. REM, or rapid eye movement, is named after the<br />\ncharacteristic eye movements<br />\nassociated with the dreaming<br />\nphase. It gets longer with each cycle, and can last as long as 40<br />\nminutes in the final bout of<br />\ndreaming prior to awakening.<br />\nDoug Cann, a Jungian analyst<br />\nand a doctor of psychology, is<br />\none of about 10 individuals in<br />\nCanada qualified to analyze and<br />\ninterpret dreams with regard to<br />\nthe disciplines of Carl Jung.<br />\n\"The dream comes from<br />\nanother side of your personality<br />\nand I would say its primary function is to balance and compensate<br />\nthe conscious view points or attitudes towards situations, particularly when they get out of line<br />\nwith what's needed to actually<br />\nadapt and grow,\" he said.<br />\nIt's very common to awaken<br />\nand not remember dreaming.<br />\nDream recall has to do with what<br />\nstage of sleep you awakened from<br />\nsince memories of dreams are<br />\nvery transitory and are quickly<br />\nforgotten unless you awake in the<br />\nmiddle of a dream. Such interruptions can be a result of an external disturbance or from the impact of the dream jolting you to<br />\nconsciousness.<br /><br />\n\"Sometimes we have dreams<br />\nthat are very everyday so there<br />\nisn't a lot of salience or impact in<br />\nthat dream and so you don't<br />\nawaken with a strong memory of<br />\nit. Other times you have a<br />\nnightmare. It wakes you up; the<br />\npower of the impact is so great<br />\nyou actually are pulled out of<br />\nyour sleep. Those kinds of<br />\ndreams aren't usually too difficult<br />\nto recall,\" said Cann.<br />\n\"If you have a dream that has<br />\ncome a number of time, it's like<br />\nan insistent message, the unconsicous is saying this one is important and you need to take note of<br />\nit,\" he said with reference to the<br />\nnotion that both recurring dreams<br />\nand the relative potency of dream<br />\nimages alert to an unresolved<br />\nsituation in our lives. If the dream<br />\ndoes not interrupt the sleep cycle,<br />\nit means we have found some way<br />\nof coping with the situation.<br />\nSince it has been demonstrated<br />\nthat animals also dream, there<br />\nwould appear to be an even more<br />\nbasic need or requirement for<br />\ndreaming. As Cann explained,<br />\n\"The biological theories for the<br />\nfunction of dreaming have to do<br />\nwith the maturation of the nervous system. Before a child is<br />\nborn there is a very high proportion of time spent in REM sleep,<br />\nsomewhere around 80 percent,<br />\nand as you grow that proportion<br />\ndrops. You get a very high proportion of it in the early stages of<br />\nboth physiological and maturational development. Part of the<br />\ntheory is that it has biological<br />\nfunction in helping the brain to<br />\nlay down neural pathways in<br />\ndeveloping patterns of the perceptual organ.\"<br />\nOne of the frustrating aspects<br />\nof dreams is their lack of lucidity<br />\nand rationality.

MD Relays<br />\nby Laura Perlinn<br />\nThe women's track team opened up their 1988 season last<br />\nSaturday, April 2, with an impressive tie for second place with<br />\nWestern Maryland at the Western<br />\nMaryland Relays, the best that<br />\nHopkins has ever done at that<br />\nmeet. Hopkins scored 62 points<br />\nbehind Messiah, who had a<br />\nphenomenal 120 points (maybe<br />\nbecause it was Easter weekend)<br />\nbut ahead of MAC rivals Dickinson, Susquehanna, Juniata, and<br />\nGettysburg.<br />\nBesides their team success,<br />\nthere were numerous individual<br />\nsuccesses, as co-captain Laura<br />\nPerlinn broke the school record<br />\nin the 400 meter hurdles with a<br />\ntime of 70.6, Krista Johnson<br />\nbroke her own school record in<br />\nthe triple jump with a jump of<br />\n34'2\", and the 4 X 100 meter<br />\nrelay team of Mary Gifford,<br /><br />\nDiana Logan, Perlinn, and<br />\nJohnson also broke the school<br />\nrecord with a time of 52.4. As<br />\nCoach Gary Green said, \"It is<br />\nremarkable that three records got<br />\nbroken in one meet, let alone in<br />\nthe first meet of the season.\"<br />\nHopkins also qualified several<br />\nwomen to the MAC Championship meet in May, namely Perlinn<br />\nin the 400 hurdles, Johnson in the<br />\ntriple jump, the 4 X 100 and the<br />\n4 X 400 (Perlinn, Gifford,<br />\nLogan, and co-captain Suzi<br />\nMcGinn), and April Savoye in the<br />\nlong jump and the triple jump.<br />\nHopkins won only one race, the<br />\n4 X 200 of Gifford, Jean Wu,<br />\nDana Fuqua, and Johnson, when<br />\nMessiah was disqualified. Second<br />\nplaces were earned by the 4 X<br />\n100, the triple jump team of<br />\nJohnson and Savoye, and the<br />\nSprint Medley team of Fuqua,<br />\nLani Firester, Savoye, and<br /><br />\nLogan.<br />\nFor the distance runners, a<br />\nrelay meet is very different. First<br />\nof all, nobody could qualify for<br />\nthe MAC meet because one can't<br />\nuse relay splits as qualifying<br />\ntimes, and second, it's often hard<br />\nto pace oneself running a long<br />\nrelay leg. Still, good performances were turned in by Suzi<br />\nMcGinn in the Distance Medley<br />\nand 4 X 800, Molly Bardsley in<br />\nthe Distance Medley and the 4 X<br />\n1600. Audra Mai in the 4 X 800<br />\nand the 4 X 1600, Stephanie<br />\nSnedden in the Distance Medley<br />\nand 4 X 800, Tamsen Love in the<br />\n4 X 800 and 4 X 1600, Donya<br />\nNiedzwiedzki in the Distance<br />\nMedley, and Tracy Hourigan in<br />\nthe 4 X 1600.<br />\nBoth Coach Green and Coach<br />\nEleanor Simonsick were extremely pleased with the women's performances. \"We have a lot of<br /><br />\ndepth, a lot of talent, and we're<br />\nin real good shape,\" Green said.<br />\nThe team does have one weakness<br />\nthis year, however, and that is in<br />\nthe throwing events. Their one<br />\n\"weight\" woman, Sheryl Bedno,<br />\nthrew the discus well but couldn't<br />\nscore at Western Maryland by<br />\nherself. Also, because nobody is<br />\ncompeting in the shot put,javelin,<br />\nor high jump, the Lady Jays are<br />\ngoing to be at a big disadvantage<br />\nin dual and tri-meets.<br />\nThe men's team, unfortunately, didn't fare as well as the<br />\nwomen at Western Maryland,<br />\nplacing fifth overall in a field of<br />\nnine. Successful relays included<br />\nthe javelin, in which Eric<br />\nHastings and Glenn Sabin threw<br />\nfor a combined distance of<br />\n338'5\" to take first place in that<br />\nevent. Hastings' own javelin<br />\nthrow of 175'3\" qualified him for<br />\nthe MAC meet in May. Hastings<br /><br />\nand Sabin also took second in the<br />\nshot put with a combined distance<br />\nof 73'6\" and fourth in the discus.<br />\nThe running events that did well<br />\nwere the second place Sprint<br />\nMedley team of Matt Hannon,<br />\nJerry Sewack, Paul Park, and<br />\nScott Baker, the second place 4<br />\nX 1600 team of Tim Marean,<br />\nBrett Balinsky, Bassil Dahiyat,<br />\nand Mark Melia, and the third<br />\nplace Distance Medley team of<br />\nMark Sullivan, Park, Baker, and<br />\nMarean.<br />\nBoth teams travel to Pennsylvania this weekend to compete<br />\nin the Messiah Invitational, a<br />\nmeet that will feature some of<br />\nHopkins' toughest competitors in<br />\nthe MAC Conference.

The<br />\nstroke for the shell was freshman<br />\nInge Schlate, while freshmen<br />\nKim Roberts, Susan Llewellyn,<br />\nMelody Swartz, Jennifer Sharp,<br />\nKathy McCabe, and Beth Chapman, and sophomore Cathy<br />\nChuang also rowed in the shell.<br />\nThe women's varsity 4-man<br />\nshell also finished its race in<br />\nfourth place. The boat's time was<br />\n8:08, 6 seconds behind thirdplace Mary Washington College.<br /><br />\nFranklin &amp; Marshall University<br />\nwon the event with a time of;<br />\n7:49. The varsity shell suffered a<br />\npersonnel change due to illness<br />\nwhich forced Cathy McCabe to<br />\nrow in both races. Stroke for the<br />\nboat was senior Pat McManmon,<br />\nwhile sophomores Kelly Kieffer<br />\nand Micheline Tang also rowed<br />\nin the boat. The shell's coxswain<br />\nwas team captain Charlene Hu.<br />\nThe crew will race at the same<br />\nlocation against some of the samel<br />\nteams next week, and the event;<br />\nwill give the crew a good chance<br />\nto show its progress.<br /><br />\nThe Johns Hopkins men's<br />\nnovice 8-man shell performed<br />\nvery well in a regatta on the Occoquan Reservoir on Saturday,<br />\nApril 2. Rowing against George<br />\nMason University, George<br />\nWashington University, and<br />\nWashington College, Johns<br />\nHopkins finished second in a very<br />\nclose race. George Washington<br />\nUniversity won the event with a<br />\ntime of 6 minutes 18 seconds.<br />\nJohns Hopkins finished at 6:33,<br />\nand Washington College finished<br /><br />\nthird at 6:34.
