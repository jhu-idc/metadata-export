In his own<br />\ninvestigations, Dr. Wood said two<br />\nsuperposed telephone directories were<br />\nrequired to stop one detonator, the<br />\npellet going through 1200 pages.<br />\nProfessor Wood has also made a<br />\nspectroscopic study of several high<br />\nexplosives.<br />\n<br />\nDR.

He continued to practice philanthropy, until it became apparent that he could not thus make<br />\nmuch headway in diminishing poverty. On the advice of a friend he pulled<br />\nup his stakes and went to America<br />\nand returned a couple of years later<br />\nwith a Bachelor of Divinity degree<br />\nwon at the Princeton Theological<br />\nSeminary. He married and soon<br />\nstarted on a new tack towards decreasing the poor. This was to organize and assist the industrial workers,<br />\nwho were better able to care for the<br />\nslums' \"down-and-outers\", and in this<br />\nconnection he wrote his first book,<br />\nThe Adoration of the Laborer, in<br />\nwhich he propounded a remark, a<br />\n\u2022masic axiom to him: \"The laborer<br />\nproduces the things which the rest of<br />\nsociety needs; therefore, his status in<br />\nsociety is more essential to it than<br />\nthat of the king.\"<br />\nHelped Laborers Greatly<br />\nIn the Japanese rice riots of 1919<br />\nthe thirty-year-old cleric obtained<br />\ngreat gains for the workers. Working<br />\nhand-in-glove with the governor of<br />\nKobe, he secured plenty of food for<br />\nthe poor people. Two years later, by<br />\nhis magnificent personality and great<br />\nhold over the people, he prayed and,<br />\nin so doing, put down a Communist<br />\nuprising. For his pains, he was jailed<br />\nfor a fortnight, but during that time<br />\nhad an opportunity to finish his third<br />\nautobiographical book, Listening to<br />\nthe Voice of the Wall.<br />\nHis previous tales of his experiences and expressions of his philosophies were best sellers and captured<br />\nthe hearts of the progressive young<br />\nintellectuals of the nation. A few<br />\nmonths later he was called upon by<br />\nthe Tokyo government to settle another \"reign of terror.\" He'later assisted the Premier, who was Chairman of the Reconstruction Commission.<br />\nPreached Twice Nightly<br />\nPreaching twice nightly, he later became the organizer and leader of the<br />\nKingdom of God movement and converted many thousands of Nipponese<br />\nto Christianity. In fact, 65,000 of Japan's youth signed cards affirming<br />\ntheir faith. Together with his evangelistic work he acted as head of the<br />\nSocial Bureau of Tokyo, having the<br />\nmayor himself as a subordinate. He<br />\ngreatly aided a citizens' cooperative<br />\nprogram and was materially responsible for opening Tokyo's first inexpensive hospital. Ever since 1923 he has<br />\nbeen a highly-esteemed adviser of<br />\nthe Japanese government.<br />\nAlthough his royalties from his<br />\nbooks amount to more than $10,000<br />\na year and his other sources of income are equally profitable, Dr. Kagawa is said to live on $40 a week,<br />\nsupporting a wife and three children.<br /><br />\nDEBATING TEAM OPENS<br />\nSEASON THIS FRIDAY<br /><br />\nSensitive Enough To<br />\nBe Detonated By A<br />\nHousefly<br /><br />\nAn explosive so sensitive that it<br />\nexplodes by the weight of a housefly<br />\nalighting on it was described by Prof.<br />\nR. W. Wood to the American Association for the Advancement of Science.<br />\nIt is the iodide of nitrogen, which<br />\ncan be detonated by the gentlest of<br />\nforces.<br />\nProfessor Wood gave this as one<br />\nexample of striking physical effects<br />\nof certain high explosives. He stressed<br />\nthe fact that \"too much publicity cannot be given to the disastrous effects<br />\nproduced by detonators which project a copper pellet with a velocity<br />\nof 6,000 feet per second, three times<br />\nthe velocity of a rifle bullet and<br />\ngreater than the velocity of the shells<br />\nwhich were fired on Paris from a distance of 75 miles during the World<br />\nWar.\"<br />\nAs an example, he cited the almost<br />\ninstant death of a Baltimore woman<br />\nwho was struck by a small pellet of<br />\nmetal, which, as Dr. Wood, to whom<br />\nit was submitted for investigation,<br />\nlater proved, turned out to be a detonator left in the coal by some careless miner.<br />\nHe gave accounts of the experiments of earlier investigatort, including a lantern slide showing the<br />\niinpressions of even the smallest<br />\nveins of the leaf of an apple tree<br />\nmade on a block of steel by exploding gun-cotton above it. In his own<br />\ninvestigations, Dr. Wood said two<br />\nsuperposed telephone directories were<br />\nrequired to stop one detonator, the<br />\npellet going through 1200 pages.<br />\nProfessor Wood has also made a<br />\nspectroscopic study of several high<br />\nexplosives.<br /><br />\nDR.
