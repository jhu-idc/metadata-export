The senior class financed<br />\nthe trip, and saw to it that the<br />\nparty was chaperoned. Some two<br />\nhundred and fifty people were on<br />\nboard the steamer \"Annapolis\"\u2014the<br />\nwhole college department, some<br />\ngraduate students, a number of professors we are glad to say, and the<br />\nrequisite for all good times, especially a senior picnic\u2014many ladies.<br />\nThe \"Annapolis\" left Pier 6,<br />\nLight Street, at three o'clock with<br />\nits load of pleasure seekers. It<br />\nwas not long before the boat became noisy, above and below.<br />\nGroups upon the top deck sang, and<br />\na large group on the bottom deck<br />\ndanced to the delightful \"modulations\" of a three-piece orchestra.<br />\nThere was but one drawback; there<br />\nwere too many aboard who wanted<br />\nto dance, and they found it extremely difficult to avoid collisions<br />\n\u2014with other dancers, not icebergs<br />\n\u2014for there were no icebergs in the<br />\nbay on Friday, so there was no<br />\ndanger from that source.<br />\nThe boat reached Annapolis at<br />\nseven o'clock. . She stayed at the<br />\ndock for an hour and a half so that<br />\nthe crowd could walk about the<br />\ntown and explore. Some had dinner at Carvel Hall, others visited<br />\nthe Capitol and still others wandered about the grounds of the<br />\nNaval Academy, which were astir<br />\nwith middies in their dress clothes<br />\nwaiting for the commencement ball.<br />\nTwo training ships, which were<br />\ndocked at the Academy wharves,<br />\nwere open to visitors. Some of the<br />\nparty went down to Annapolis by<br />\ntrain and came back to Baltimore<br />\non the boat.<br />\nThe return trip was as enjoyable<br />\nas the first part of the excursion.<br />\nIt lacked only one thing, and that<br />\nwas a full moon. The lower deck<br />\nwas crowded again with the dancers, and even when the \"Annapolis\" had been docked at Pier 6, the<br />\n(lancing continued fully ten minutes.<br />\nThe people hated to leave.<br />\n<br />\nFor the first time in the three<br />\nyears a senior .prom was held in<br />\nMcCoy Hall last Thursday night.<br />\nMore than sixty couples were present\u2014equalling the usual attendance<br />\nat the regular cotillons and considerably exceeding the attendance<br />\nat most of the proms in the past.<br />\nThe hall was elaborately decorated with streamers, spreading out<br />\nto all corners of the room from the<br />\ncenter, where hung the class flag<br />\nof 1912. The corridors were<br />\ndraped with the flags of the other<br />\nclasses. These decorations were<br />\ndue entirely to the efforts of<br />\nMessrs. Easter, Gail and Schmeisser, who deserve great credit for<br />\ntheir artistic taste and willing labor.<br />\nDuring the course of the evening<br />\nrefreshments were served, which<br />\neveryone pronounced to be excellent. The whole senior class, with<br />\nthree or four exceptions, were present, and a general spirit of goodfellowship prevailed. There was a<br />\nnotable lack of only one thing\u2014<br />\nchaperones\u2014few of the wives of<br />\nthe professors being present.<br />\nIn the various intermissions between the dances, Eutaw street and<br />\nMonument street presented a gala<br />\n-spectacle, serving as a promenade<br />\nfor the winded swains and their<br />\npanting dulcineas. White trousers<br />\nand pink lawns were everywhere<br />\nvisible under the spreading trees,<br />\nand necessity made out of a city<br />\nstreet a very presentable college<br />\ncampus.<br />\nThe dancing continued to the unheard-of hour of 12.30 A. M., and<br />\nwhen the time at last came to depart, there were few . who did not<br />\nleave with their lips repeating- the<br />\nPrayer: \"Jove, send us more such<br />\nnights as this!\"<br />\nWhether or not the prayer will<br />\nbe answered is now up to next<br />\nyear's graduating class. .<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nThe Medical Standard Book Co.<br />\n307 N.

It inaugurates what we cannot but consider a worthy custom\u2014the custom<br />\nof spontaneous original literary production, which has hitherto characterized our American colleges only<br />\ntoo little. The play might be better; it might be worse; its author<br />\nwill surely pardon us if we say of<br />\nit what lartial was content to say<br />\nof his own work:<br />\nHere's some that's good, and some that's<br />\nbad,<br />\nAnd some that's only fair;<br />\nAnd that's the most that can be said<br />\nOf any book whate'er.<br />\nThe Class of 1912.<br />\n<br />\nTli'e. class which will be graduated next Tuesday has been a<br />\nnotable one for its efforts and its<br />\nachievements\u2014individually and collectively. It includes a large number of men who have made themselves prominent in undergraduate<br />\nlife. It includes a large number<br />\nof men who have won distinction<br />\nin undergraduate scholarship. Four<br />\nof its members' have been captains<br />\nof University athletic teams; and<br />\none of those four has been captain<br />\nof two different teams.

It has<br />\nstriven to be the paper of the students and the paper of the alumni;<br />\nto keep them both in touch with<br />\nwhat is going on and to give them<br />\nboth an opportunity to express their<br />\nviews on matters of consequence<br />\nto Hopkins.

The senior class financed<br />\nthe trip, and saw to it that the<br />\nparty was chaperoned. Some two<br />\nhundred and fifty people were on<br />\nboard the steamer \"Annapolis\"\u2014the<br />\nwhole college department, some<br />\ngraduate students, a number of professors we are glad to say, and the<br />\nrequisite for all good times, especially a senior picnic\u2014many ladies.<br />\nThe \"Annapolis\" left Pier 6,<br />\nLight Street, at three o'clock with<br />\nits load of pleasure seekers. It<br />\nwas not long before the boat became noisy, above and below.<br />\nGroups upon the top deck sang, and<br />\na large group on the bottom deck<br />\ndanced to the delightful \"modulations\" of a three-piece orchestra.<br />\nThere was but one drawback; there<br />\nwere too many aboard who wanted<br />\nto dance, and they found it extremely difficult to avoid collisions<br />\n\u2014with other dancers, not icebergs<br />\n\u2014for there were no icebergs in the<br />\nbay on Friday, so there was no<br />\ndanger from that source.<br />\nThe boat reached Annapolis at<br />\nseven o'clock. . She stayed at the<br />\ndock for an hour and a half so that<br />\nthe crowd could walk about the<br />\ntown and explore. Some had dinner at Carvel Hall, others visited<br />\nthe Capitol and still others wandered about the grounds of the<br />\nNaval Academy, which were astir<br />\nwith middies in their dress clothes<br />\nwaiting for the commencement ball.<br />\nTwo training ships, which were<br />\ndocked at the Academy wharves,<br />\nwere open to visitors. Some of the<br />\nparty went down to Annapolis by<br />\ntrain and came back to Baltimore<br />\non the boat.<br />\nThe return trip was as enjoyable<br />\nas the first part of the excursion.<br />\nIt lacked only one thing, and that<br />\nwas a full moon. The lower deck<br />\nwas crowded again with the dancers, and even when the \"Annapolis\" had been docked at Pier 6, the<br />\n(lancing continued fully ten minutes.<br />\nThe people hated to leave.<br /><br />\nFor the first time in the three<br />\nyears a senior .prom was held in<br />\nMcCoy Hall last Thursday night.<br />\nMore than sixty couples were present\u2014equalling the usual attendance<br />\nat the regular cotillons and considerably exceeding the attendance<br />\nat most of the proms in the past.<br />\nThe hall was elaborately decorated with streamers, spreading out<br />\nto all corners of the room from the<br />\ncenter, where hung the class flag<br />\nof 1912. The corridors were<br />\ndraped with the flags of the other<br />\nclasses. These decorations were<br />\ndue entirely to the efforts of<br />\nMessrs. Easter, Gail and Schmeisser, who deserve great credit for<br />\ntheir artistic taste and willing labor.<br />\nDuring the course of the evening<br />\nrefreshments were served, which<br />\neveryone pronounced to be excellent. The whole senior class, with<br />\nthree or four exceptions, were present, and a general spirit of goodfellowship prevailed. There was a<br />\nnotable lack of only one thing\u2014<br />\nchaperones\u2014few of the wives of<br />\nthe professors being present.<br />\nIn the various intermissions between the dances, Eutaw street and<br />\nMonument street presented a gala<br />\n-spectacle, serving as a promenade<br />\nfor the winded swains and their<br />\npanting dulcineas. White trousers<br />\nand pink lawns were everywhere<br />\nvisible under the spreading trees,<br />\nand necessity made out of a city<br />\nstreet a very presentable college<br />\ncampus.<br />\nThe dancing continued to the unheard-of hour of 12.30 A. M., and<br />\nwhen the time at last came to depart, there were few . who did not<br />\nleave with their lips repeating- the<br />\nPrayer: \"Jove, send us more such<br />\nnights as this!\"<br />\nWhether or not the prayer will<br />\nbe answered is now up to next<br />\nyear's graduating class. .<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nThe Medical Standard Book Co.<br />\n307 N.

It inaugurates what we cannot but consider a worthy custom\u2014the custom<br />\nof spontaneous original literary production, which has hitherto characterized our American colleges only<br />\ntoo little. The play might be better; it might be worse; its author<br />\nwill surely pardon us if we say of<br />\nit what lartial was content to say<br />\nof his own work:<br />\nHere's some that's good, and some that's<br />\nbad,<br />\nAnd some that's only fair;<br />\nAnd that's the most that can be said<br />\nOf any book whate'er.<br />\nThe Class of 1912.<br /><br />\nTli'e. class which will be graduated next Tuesday has been a<br />\nnotable one for its efforts and its<br />\nachievements\u2014individually and collectively.

It includes a large number<br />\nof men who have won distinction<br />\nin undergraduate scholarship. Four<br />\nof its members' have been captains<br />\nof University athletic teams; and<br />\none of those four has been captain<br />\nof two different teams. It has<br />\ngiven us two presidents of the Athletic Association. It has given us<br />\nfour members of 'Varsity debating<br />\nteams. It has supplied two editors of THE NEWS-LETTER.

It has<br />\nstriven to be the paper of the students and the paper of the alumni;<br />\nto keep them both in touch with<br />\nwhat is going on and to give them<br />\nboth an opportunity to express their<br />\nviews on matters of consequence<br />\nto Hopkins. It has endeavored to<br />\nfill a necessary place in the life of<br />\nthe University; and in the future it<br />\nwill endeavor to fill that place with<br />\never-increasing credit.<br />\nIn the present issue is enclosed<br />\na renewal blank, which we .hope<br />\nwill be signed and sent to us by return mail. \u2022<br />\nThe Senior Class Book.<br /><br />\nThe senior class book, which<br />\nmade its appearance during the<br />\nearly part of the week, does not<br />\nseem to be selling as fast as its<br />\nprojectors believed that it would.<br />\nThe book has been seen by everyone, and there are many, who having seen somebody else's copy, do<br />\nnot see fit to purchase copies of<br />\ntheir own. This attitude is unjustifiable. Everybody pronounces the<br />\nbook thoroughly funny and everybody is perfectly willing to enjoy<br />\nit; let everybody remember that it<br />\nwas made possible only by financial<br />\nexpenditure, and that the fun which<br />\nit supplies cannot be supplied<br />\ngratuitous. The only way to ensure a year book next year is by<br />\nmaking this year's book a success;<br />\nbut, leaving that question entirely<br />\naside, it, is the moral duty of those<br />\nwho have been enjoying the book<br />\nto step up and pay the piper.
