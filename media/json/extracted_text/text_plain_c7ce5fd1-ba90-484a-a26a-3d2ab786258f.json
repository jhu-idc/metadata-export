He is \"delighted\" at the high number of<br />\npeople who voted, and says that<br />\n<br />\nthe overwhelming vote against<br />\nplus/minus grading does not<br />\nsurprise him greatly.

They<br />\nwere asked to contribute their<br />\nideas so that the Young Democrats will have a better idea as to<br />\nwhat planks in their platform<br />\nneed revision.<br />\nEach of the nine witnesses<br />\nwas given a set time to issue his<br />\nor her statement, and then<br />\nreceived questions from. the<br />\npanel:<br />\nBrett Weiss, Charles<br />\nKruzansky, Leonard Lucci, Greg<br />\nPecararo, and Vincent De Marco.<br />\nCharlie King of Americans<br />\nfor Democratic Action said<br />\nliberals are in the process of<br />\nreassessment, and thus should<br />\nsteer their interests towards the<br />\ngoals of education for all, and<br />\nthe availability of financial aid<br />\nfor those who cannot afford<br />\nhigher education. He said \"an<br />\neducation process needs to take<br />\nplace\" in regard to Reaganomics<br />\nand seemed worried about<br />\n\"President Reagan's retrenchment on civil rights.\"<br />\nThis was also the concern of<br />\nLaura Murphy of the American<br />\nCivil Liberties Union. Murphy<br />\nconcentrated mostly on the<br />\nVoting Rights Act, which is up<br />\nfor reassessment, and how this<br />\nreassessment was seen as a<br />\n\"structural attack on amendments to the Constitution.\"<br />\n<br />\nAt the present, several mostly<br />\nsouthern states are covered by<br />\nthe act. The Justice Department<br />\nreviews all laws passed within<br />\nthese states to make sure they<br />\nare not discriminatory. Brett<br />\nWeiss, chairman of the hearing,<br />\nfound it \"ironic\" that such a<br />\nsubstantial piece of legislation is<br />\nup for reassessment.<br />\nOne key issue for the Young<br />\nDemocrats seems to be the<br />\nrecruitment of minorities into<br />\nthe party. Charlie King suggested that blacks are disenchanted<br />\nwith the party but offered<br />\nanother problem in their recruitment: if you seek out minorities, you will seem paternalistic;<br />\nif you ignore them, you are<br />\nracist.<br />\nGeorge Bunt of the NAACP<br />\nDemocrats<br />\nwas emphatic:<br />\nshould go \"back to a party of<br />\ncompassion\" and \"stop trying to<br />\nout-Reagan Reagan.\" His major<br />\nconcerns centered on cuts in<br />\nassistance programs such as job<br />\ntraining, education, food, especially for children, and affirmative action. He said the only<br />\nway to interest minorities in the<br />\nDemocratic Party again is to<br />\nsupport programs that will appeal to them. Murphy agreed,<br />\nobserving that the people do<br />\nnot participate because they do<br />\nnot believe the system works for<br />\nthem.<br />\nThree other key issues were<br />\ndiscussed: nuclear power, the<br />\nFamily Protection Act and abortion. On the latter subject, three<br />\npeople testified: Professor Chris<br />\n<br />\nWilliams of the National Lawyers Guild, Joseph McPherson of<br />\nMaryland Right to Life, and<br />\nSteve Rivilus of Planned Parenthood of Maryland.<br />\nWilliams concentrated on<br />\nthe Family Protection Act currently being sponsored in Congress, which has sometimes been<br />\ncalled the \"right-wing shopping<br />\nlist.\"<br />\nThe act's provisions<br />\ninclude \"an all-out attack on<br />\ngay/lesbian citizens,\" and tax<br />\nincentives for households which<br />\ncontain aged people. Such an<br />\nincentive is seen as a means of<br />\nkeeping the family a unit.<br />\nActually, according to Williams,<br />\nthis would be a burden to the<br />\nfamily, keeping a family member<br />\n\u2014 most likely the woman \u2014 at<br />\nhome to care for the aged one.<br />\nThis, said Williams, is the intent<br />\nof the sponsors, who want to<br />\ndeny women their rights, and is<br />\n\"an effort to legalize government intrusion into areas of<br />\nprivate choice.., in the right-wing<br />\nconservative tradition.\"<br />\nJoseph McPherson presented a different perspective. He<br />\nsees the 1973 Supreme Court<br />\nruling in favor of abortion as an<br />\n\"attack upon human dignity,\"<br />\nadding that it is \"an exercise<br />\nin raw judicial power.\" By such<br />\nmeasures, he believes our government \"loses its moral authority.\" McPherson then argued<br />\nthat because society loses its<br />\nrespect for itself, weapon production and economic stimulation occur. When questioned, he<br />\nexplained that once a healthy<br />\n<br />\nfamily life has been lost, material goods become more important; hence, the economy is<br />\nstimulated.<br />\nHe offered no<br />\nevidence to back up his theory.<br />\nSteve Rivilus, Public Affairs<br />\nDirector of Planned Parenthood,<br />\nfollowed McPherson. He told<br />\nthe panel that the \"Democrats<br />\nshould regroup\" to protect the<br />\nrights of the poor, minorities,<br />\nwomen, and aged. Strongly<br />\nopposed to any restriction of<br />\nreproductive freedom, Rivilus<br />\nsaid that since there is no right<br />\ndecision for all women on<br />\nabortion, \"then government<br />\nmust never interfere\" with these<br />\nrights. He cited a poll taken<br />\nrecently which found that 90<br />\npercent of the U.S. population<br />\nfavored<br />\nlegalized<br />\nabortion<br />\nwhereas a relatively minor 10<br />\npercent were against it. This, he<br />\n<br />\nbelieves, is proof that the<br />\nMoral Majority is not nearly as<br />\nrepresentative of the population<br />\nas first believed. Rivilus also told<br />\nthe panel that they should apply<br />\ntheir efforts to the Medicaid<br />\nbenefits which are available for<br />\nabortions only when a woman's<br />\nlife is endangered.<br />\nRandall of the Professional<br />\nNuclear Society said at the start<br />\nof his testimony that he did not<br />\nbelieve nuclear power should be<br />\na partisan issue. He noted that,<br />\nat the present, nuclear power in<br />\nthe U.S. produces as much<br />\nenergy as is shipped down<br />\nthrough the Alaskan Pipeline, or<br />\n1.5 million barrels of oil a day.<br />\nThirty-three licenses are in the<br />\nprocess of being issued to build<br />\nnuclear power plants across the<br />\ncountry, and by 1985 they<br />\ncont. on p. 7<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\nInternational Begins<br />\nRecruitment Effort At JHU<br />\ncont. from p.1<br />\nAI-JHU will be writing<br />\nletters on the Mykaylenko case<br />\nin addition to its usual \"urgent<br />\naction\" letters.

Dean of Graduate and Undergraduate Studies Michael Hooker has predicted<br />\nthat the Academic -Council is going to<br />\nignore the fact- that this was the largest<br />\nstudent-voter turnout in many years, and<br />\nstick with plus/minus grading anyway.<br />\nSurprise, surprise. But wait \u2014 this is really<br />\n<br />\nuncalled-for hostility that you<br />\nhave shown.<br />\nSomewhere in the last third<br />\nof your article, you envision a<br />\nnon-biological family consisting<br />\nof'intimate friends.

It's becoming increasingly obvious<br />\nthat, on serious matters where a real<br />\ndifference of opinion between students and<br />\nadministration is at stake, the administration can and will override all objections. If<br />\nthey override this one, they might as well<br />\nabolish the Student Council and all other<br />\nforms of democratic expression around<br />\nhere.

I<br />\ncan see no point in doing this<br />\nbeyond, perhaps, the first paragraph. It is obvious that Hook is<br />\n<br />\nWomen Want Families, Too<br />\ncont. from p. 4<br />\nlear family. Then is no inherent<br />\nquality in comn anal living that<br />\nmakes it less s,2xist than any<br />\n3ther type of gn,aping. It is the<br />\nindividuals in a group who<br />\ndetermine its sexist or non-sexist<br />\nnature. For this reason, the<br />\nbiological family need not be<br />\nmale-dominated either.<br />\nEqual rights for men and<br />\nwomen does not have to destroy<br />\nthe institution of marriage. You<br />\nmake the valid points that<br />\n\"male-female relationships are<br />\nchanging fundamentally\" and<br />\nthat \"marriage used to be a<br />\npower relationship.\" These are<br />\nnot reasons, however, for abandoning marriage. As relationships between men and women<br />\nmove increasingly toward greater<br />\nequality, marriage will cease to<br />\nbe a power relationship based on<br />\nmale domination.<br />\nIt is not clear to me what<br />\nyour opinion of marriage is.<br />\nThough you mention that some<br />\nmembers of a<br />\nnon-biological<br />\nfamily might be married, you<br />\nvisualize them leaving the family<br />\nfreely. You seem to be confusing marriage with temporary<br />\nrelationships. The only distinction marriage holds among other<br />\nrelationships is its permanence.<br />\nAnd be realistic: the abandoned<br />\nspouse and children you mention are going to feel just as<br />\nemotionally hurt as in the<br />\nbiological family.<br />\nYou have already stated<br />\nthat biological parents are ultimately responsible for their<br />\nchildren, but you have them<br />\ncarelessly leaving the family<br />\nwithout guilt. Suppose both<br />\nbiological parents decide to cut<br />\nout; at what point does this<br />\nfreedom begin to be traded<br />\nChildren,<br />\nfor responsibility?<br />\nbecause they are no selfneed<br />\npermanent<br />\nsufficient,<br />\nparents. The nuclear family is<br />\nthe best menas that has been<br />\nfound for providing this because<br />\nit is based on the permanence of<br />\nmarriage.<br />\n<br />\nYou have brought up an<br />\ninteresting alternative to marriage, but it is not a practical<br />\nsolution for everyone, specifically not for those with children. Though a nuclear family<br />\nmight be incorporated into the<br />\nextended family you have described, parents could not enjoy<br />\nthe freedom you encourage. In<br />\nthe end, there must remain a<br />\nnuclear family.<br />\nAlso, I do not understand<br />\nthe link you have made between equality of rights and a<br />\nneed for non-biological families.<br />\nThe conflict you describe between self-sufficiency and isolation is not new, as you demonstrate by citing Aristotle. The<br />\nbenefits of increased interaction<br />\nand affection found in an<br />\nextended, non-biological family<br />\nare not related to the benefits<br />\nof equality.<br />\nSome of the other arguments you use to support<br />\nyour argument are just as<br />\nspuriously linked. You have a<br />\ngood idea, but you do not need<br />\nto prove it is a cure-all. The<br />\nnon-biological family is not<br />\n<br />\ngoing to end unemployment<br />\nand prejudice against homosexuality. I wish a single answer<br />\ncould end all of our problems<br />\ntoo, but there is no such solution.<br />\nFinally, the way in which<br />\nyou have written your article<br />\nultimately reveals a hostility<br />\nwhich is unwarranted. \"Feminism, when limited to ideas of<br />\nself-sufficiency, must ultimately<br />\nbe described as bourgeois, aiding<br />\nthe bourgeoisie and ultimately<br />\nharming most women and men.\"<br />\nWait a minute: what are you<br />\ntalking about here? Since when<br />\nhas feminism been limited to<br />\nideas .of self-sufficiency? Selfsufficiency is the ability to<br />\nsurvive alone.. Few want to<br />\nlive a life alone and isolated,<br />\nbut in case of tragedy everyone<br />\nneeds this ability.<br />\nRight?<br />\nWhere have you heard feminists, or any one else, advocating<br />\nisolation? The pace of your<br />\narticle is quick. Ideas seem to<br />\nfly in from all directions. I<br />\nhave tried to see the logic<br />\nof ,what you are saying, but at<br />\nthis point! am lost.<br />\n<br />\nmore interested in showing us<br />\nhow clever he is rather than in<br />\ncriticizing the play.<br />\nFinally, if Hook was in<br />\nsome way intoxicated when he<br />\nsaw the play, as he strongly hints<br />\nin his closing paragraph, what<br />\nbusiness has he reviewing the<br />\nplay in the first place? I suppose<br />\nhis state of mind can be used as<br />\nan excuse for his review; it does<br />\nnot, however, excuse the staff<br />\n<br />\nof the News-Letter for printing<br />\nhis article.<br />\nMark Hughes<br />\n<br />\nYou Blew It, N-L<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nInitially distressed by the<br />\nNews-Letter's lack of coverage<br />\ncont. on p. 9<br />\n<br />\nThe Outside World<br />\nThe Same Old Boss<br />\nBY BRIAN MIRSKY<br />\nAfter the election of President Reagan and the purported<br />\ntakeover of the House and<br />\nSenate by the forces of the<br />\n\"New Right.\" traditional liberals<br />\nwithin and without this university underwent a severe depression followed by near panic and<br />\npredictions of enforced moraliunemployment,<br />\nty, massive<br />\nreinstatement of the draft, and<br />\neven of warfare between the rich<br />\nand the poor. In reality such<br />\ndire premonitions have not materialized; this article was written while I was at my workstudy job at the circulation desk,<br />\nnot in a plane en route to El<br />\nSalvador. At the same time the<br />\nRepublican claims of balanced<br />\nbudgets, tax cuts, substantial<br />\nincreases in defense appropriations, increased productivity and<br />\nlower interest and inflation<br />\nrates show few signs of successful implementation, at least in<br />\nthe short run. With nearly a<br />\nyear having passed since the<br />\n1980 elections, the social and<br />\npolitical effects of the GOP<br />\nvictories seein far less profound<br />\nthan many feared.<br />\ngovernmental<br />\nRadical<br />\nchanges are not in the works.<br />\nOne characteristic of the massive<br />\nbureaucracy of the. United States<br />\nis its fondness for the status quo.<br />\nJust as the progressive social and<br />\ncivil rights changes were hard<br />\nfought and slow in coining in the<br />\n'50s and '60s, and conservative<br />\nencroachment on these principles will likely be similarly<br />\ndifficult to enact. We find that<br />\nReagan's 30 percent across-theboard tax cuts became 25<br />\n<br />\npercent<br />\n\"sort-of-across-theboard\" tax cuts, and the likelihood of increased taxes in other<br />\nareas and delays in the enactment of the third-year cuts is<br />\nquite high; a 7 percent real<br />\ngrowth rate in military spending<br />\nis quickly beginning to look very<br />\nmuch like the Carter defense<br />\nrequests; the new 12 percent<br />\nbudget cuts have received nearly<br />\nunanimous disapproval; and just<br />\nthis past week the minimum<br />\n$122 monthly social security<br />\nbenefits were restored.<br />\nIn fact, the only areas in<br />\nwhich dramatic deviations in<br />\npolicy are still being pursued are<br />\nin the Department of Interior<br />\nand Environmental Protection<br />\nAgency. But, again such changes<br />\nare destined to failure. Only<br />\nMuammar Qadafi is less popular<br />\nthan James Watt and even the<br />\nRepublican chairman of the<br />\nEnvironment and Public Works<br />\nCommittee has all but called for<br />\nthe resignation of the chair:<br />\nwoman of the EPA.

Eisenhower Library on \"The Iranian RevoluLessons for America.\"<br />\ntion:<br />\nThe lecture took place in the<br />\nGarrett Room, as part of the<br />\nWednesday Noon Series.<br />\n\"A major lesson for Amerithe Iranian crisis is that<br />\nfrom<br />\nca<br />\nwe must deal with oppressive<br />\nregimes without becoming identified with them,\" Kennedy<br />\nasserted early in his speech.<br />\nKennedy pointed out America's heavy involvement with the<br />\nShah of Iran. The United States<br />\nmade large arms deals, and set<br />\nup massive communications networks. Yet many villages did<br />\nnot even have roads.<br />\n<br />\nMoorhead Kennedy describes lessons of hostage experience.<br />\n<br />\n\"While we placed many<br />\ndemands on the Shah,\" he<br />\nexplained, \"he placed some<br />\ndemands on us. We were forced<br />\nto support him.<br />\nWhen he<br />\ncreated a police state, it was<br />\nidentified with the United<br />\nStates.\"<br />\nKennedy feels that our<br />\n<br />\nBustamante Speaks On Mexico<br />\ncont..from p. 1<br />\nA pattern of pejorative<br />\ndistinctions between old and new immigrants developed, according to Bustamante, resulting<br />\nin a mechanism of division<br />\nbetween old and new, preventing<br />\nsolidarity between the two<br />\ngroups and obscuring the fundamental problems of American<br />\nsociety.<br />\nThe economic expansion of<br />\nthe Southwest during the early<br />\n20th century created a demand<br />\nfor cheap imported foreign<br />\nlabor. The first U.S. policy of<br />\nrectuitment of Mexican workers<br />\nbegan at this time. The U.S.<br />\ncontinues to recruit Mexican<br />\nWorkers during periods of expansion.<br />\nThere are two important<br />\ndifferences between Mexican<br />\nand European immigrants. Mexican immigration is both a<br />\ncontinuous and temporary phenomenon. Most Mexican workers<br />\nreturn to their native country,<br />\nand they continue to be replaced<br />\nin the U.S. by new Mexican<br />\nimmigrants.<br />\nThe \"structural dimension\"<br />\nof Mexican immigration which<br />\n<br />\nresponds to the international<br />\nlabor market is quite different<br />\nfrom the \"perceptual dimension\" of immigration which<br />\nchanges according to conditions<br />\nof expansion and recession in<br />\nthe United States.<br />\nBlaming Mexican immigrants for problems in unemployment, public health and<br />\npublic education reflect a negative \"perceptual dimension.\"<br />\nThis occurs during recessionary<br />\nperiods.<br />\nThe benefits of importing<br />\n\"human energy from Mexico\"<br />\nare several. Employers find that<br />\nMexican immigrants reduce their<br />\ncosts of - production. The U.S.<br />\neconomy does not have to bear<br />\nthe costs of producing or reproducing the labor force because<br />\nof the temporary nature of<br />\nMexican immigration.<br />\nAny attempt to control<br />\nimmigration is unrealistic because, according to Bustamante,<br />\nthe United States needs Mexican<br />\nlabor to fill jobs in the service<br />\nsector. These immigrants are<br />\nnot competing with the unemployed because they take posi-<br />\n<br />\nNOW Sponsors Walk<br />\nFor ERA Ratification<br />\ncont. from p. 2<br />\nBecause of federal law, the<br />\nERA \u2014 which states, \"Equality<br />\nof rights under the law shall<br />\nnot be denied or abridged by the<br />\nUnited States or by any state on<br />\naccount of sex\" \u2014 will have<br />\nto be ratified by June 1, 1982.<br />\nIf three more states do not ratify<br />\nthe amendment, then the entire<br />\nlengthy procedure would have to<br />\nbegin again. Duke predicted<br />\nthat ratification by 38 states<br />\n\"would take at least another 20<br />\nyears\" due to the more conservative character of Congress and a<br />\n<br />\nlarge proportion of state legislatures.<br />\nCampus Walk-a-Thon organizers hope enough Hopkins<br />\nstudents will turn out Saturday<br />\nto walk as one group. The walk,<br />\nwhich will begin with many<br />\npro-ERA speeches, will take<br />\nparticipants from the Inner<br />\nHarbor, through South Baltimore, Federal Hill, and then<br />\nback to the Inner Harbor for an<br />\nafternoon celebration. All participants are urged to wear green<br />\nand white to show their support<br />\nfor the ERA.<br />\n<br />\ntions no one wants. Proposed<br />\nreforms of immigration laws<br />\nare \"political solutions to politically defined problems,\" Bustamante said.<br />\nThe geographical vicinity of<br />\nMexico to the U.S. cannot be<br />\navoided. The \"border has too<br />\nmany holes,\" said Bustamante.<br />\nMexican society permeates the<br />\nU.S. and U.S. society permeates<br />\nMexico. According to Bustamante, \"We just have to find a<br />\nway to learn how to live together.\"<br />\nIn response to .a question<br />\nBustamante said that \"it would<br />\nbe a problem, but not a catastrophe\" if the U.S. closed the<br />\nborders. The growth rate of the<br />\nMexican economy (twice that of<br />\nthe U.S.), combined with the oil<br />\nbonanza, will eventually find the<br />\nMexican employer competing<br />\nwith the U.S. employer for the<br />\nsame labor.<br />\nWhen asked<br />\nwhat he<br />\nthought about the exploitation<br />\nof Mexican workers in the U.S.,<br />\nBustamante responded that \"we<br />\nwould be totally in favor\" of<br />\nbetter treatment, but that if<br />\nsomehow immigrants without<br />\ndocuments had the same rights<br />\nas other workers, the demand<br />\nfor them would shrink.<br />\nJHU Social Relations Professor Alejandro Portes remarked that Bustamante's presentation was \"novel,\" \"wellresearched\" and provided a view<br />\ndistinct from what is seen in the<br />\nAmerican press and the public<br />\npronouncements of the U.S.<br />\ngovernment.<br />\nPortes agreed with \"about<br />\nthree quarters\" of the speech.<br />\nHe feels that it is premature to<br />\nsay that immigration does not<br />\nrepresent an important safety<br />\nvalve for Mexico. He is somewhat less enthusiastic than Bustamante about the prospects for<br />\nthe Mexican economy.<br />\n<br />\nsuffers myopia<br />\ngovernment<br />\nwhen it comes to foreign affairs.<br />\nWe Were more concerned with<br />\nselling a certain number of<br />\nplanes to Iran in one year than<br />\nwith where Iran was being led,<br />\nhe said.<br />\nPart of the problem lies in<br />\nthe structure of the Foreign<br />\nService itself. Foreign diplomats<br />\nhave a term of three years, and<br />\nthus must prove their worth in<br />\nthat relatively short period of<br />\ntime.<br />\nKennedy does not think<br />\nthat this problem is unique to<br />\nthe Foreign Service. \"Americans<br />\nsuffer from shortsightedness.<br />\nWe see that Detroit is suffering<br />\nfinancially, while the Japanese<br />\nautomakers are succeeding. This<br />\nis because the Japanese had the<br />\nforesight to look ahead.\"<br />\n\"I wonder what we learned<br />\nfrom Iran?\" Kennedy asked. He<br />\nfears that the U.S. may haite<br />\nlearned little, as exemplified by<br />\nthe reaction to Sadat's assassination. Reagan sent three presidents as a show of support, but<br />\nhe never addressed the question<br />\nof why the assassination occurred.<br />\n\"We made the Shah our<br />\npuppet, and now what are doing<br />\nto Egypt's President Mubarak?\"<br />\nhe questioned. \"I don't think<br />\nthat we're helping Mubarak.\"<br />\nReligion plays a major role<br />\nin these Arabic countries,<br />\nKennedy pointed out.<br />\nHe<br />\nbelieves that the Arabs are<br />\ndisillusioned with the political<br />\nideas, communism and all the<br />\nother \"\u2014isms.\" Thus, they turn<br />\nto Islam.<br />\nKennedy hopes that his<br />\nchurch, the Cathedral Church of<br />\nSt. John Divine in New York,<br />\nwill raise the question of how<br />\nreligion is tied with foreign<br />\naffairs.<br />\n\"We've got to understand<br />\nhow religion is working in these<br />\nother countries,\" he stressed.<br />\n\"We see this in Poland. Do you<br />\nthink that the Polish people<br />\ncould be as strong as they are<br />\nwithout religion?\"<br />\nKennedy then applied these<br />\nsituations abroad to America.<br />\nHe observed that the Moral<br />\nMajority institutions are churning out video messages, much<br />\nlike Khomeini did in Iran. He<br />\nfeels that we must examine the<br />\nsimilarities.<br />\n<br />\n\"We need to look ahead at<br />\nour own value structure. I hope<br />\nthat my church will address the<br />\nquestion of where we are going,<br />\nand what we want. I hope that<br />\nthis will be a lesson from Iran,\"<br />\nhe concluded.<br />\nKennedy was then asked<br />\nquestions from the large audience, most of which pertained to<br />\nhis experiences as a hostage.<br />\nWhen asked why the hostage crisis occurred, Kennedy<br />\nresponded that the American<br />\ndiplomats did not have a good<br />\nrelationship with the students<br />\nand clergymen. He explained<br />\nthat \"American diplomats only<br />\nsee the elite, not the common<br />\npeople.\"<br />\nHe told of how one of his<br />\ncaptors asked him why the<br />\ndiplomats had not known that<br />\nthe Iranians were going to take<br />\nover the embassy, when every<br />\nchild in Tehran knew it beforehand.<br />\nKennedy later spoke of a<br />\nmock execution, in which he<br />\nand several other hostages were<br />\nstripped naked and then lined up<br />\nagainst a wall.<br />\nWhen asked about the rescue attempt, Kennedy said that<br />\nhe would never have planned it.<br />\nThe hostages did not learn of the<br />\nattempt until three weeks afterwards.<br />\n\"I lived from day to day as<br />\na hostage,\" he responded to a<br />\nquestion on how he coped in<br />\ncaptivity, \"which is the only<br />\nway to live. When the cook<br />\nmade lasagna, that was a good<br />\nday; when we were given showers, that was a good day.\"<br />\nKennedy was then asked if<br />\nthe news media had overemphasized the hostage crisis. \"Even<br />\nthough it might seem that the<br />\nmedia overplayed the hostage<br />\nsituation, it did show the rest of<br />\nthe world that we are a nation<br />\nthat cares,\" he concluded.<br />\nKennedy received his J.D.<br />\ndegree from Harvard Law School<br />\nin 1959. In 1960 he entered the<br />\nU.S. Foreign Service and went<br />\non to serve in Yemen, Greece,<br />\nLebanon, and several other<br />\ncountries. He was assigned to<br />\nTehran in 1979. At the time of<br />\nthe American Embassy takeover,<br />\nhe was acting as economic<br />\ncounsellor. He has written a<br />\nbook relating his experiences as<br />\nan Iranian hostage, which is soon<br />\nto be published.<br />\n<br />\nYoung Democrats Hold<br />\nPublic Forum At JHU<br />\ncont. from O. 3<br />\ncould be producing more than<br />\n50 percent of the nation's<br />\nenergy.<br />\nThe panel's major question<br />\nwas about nuclear waste.<br />\nRandall said high-level waste,<br />\nwhich is the major cause for<br />\nconcern, is a small fraction of<br />\nwhat is actually considered<br />\nwaste. Of 100 units of fuel, two<br />\nunits are high-level waste; the<br />\nrest can be recycled and used in<br />\nthe plant again. The two units<br />\nin 100 are solidified into glasslike logs where the radioactive<br />\nelements actually become part<br />\nof the glass molecule. Metallic<br />\n<br />\nin nature, the logs, designed to<br />\nlast 500 years, are placed 2000<br />\nfeet deep in the earth at the site<br />\nof the plant.

Empowered to inquire into the concerns<br />\nof students, faculty and administrators, the Committee was also<br />\ncharged with studying the structure of the Spring Fair Board, its<br />\nrelation to the Council, and<br />\nSAC, and the Student Services<br />\nOffice; the Council also directed<br />\nthe Committee to investigate the<br />\nsize of the Fair and the degree<br />\nof security provided.<br />\nClearly, these matters are of<br />\nconsiderable importance to the<br />\nundergraduate community; one<br />\nmight accordingly expect the<br />\nNews-Letter to cover an issue of<br />\nsuch widespread interest. However, despite Student Council's<br />\nefforts to keep the N-L apprised<br />\nof its activities \u2014 Council<br />\nSecretary Lori Malloy supplied<br />\nthe N-L with a copy of the<br />\nCouncil's charge to the Committee \u2014 the N-L chose not to cover<br />\nthe Committee's work. When<br />\nthe N-L finally decided to cover<br />\nthe Coi-nmittee's efforts, the<br />\nreporter assigned did not even<br />\nattend a single Committee meeting.<br />\nAs 'to the specifics of the<br />\narticle, the N-L's reporting was a<br />\nwealth of misinformation. In the<br />\nfirst place, the Committee has<br />\nbeen meeting not once, but<br />\n*twice, per week. At one of our<br />\nmany meetings, Major Larkin,<br />\nchief of Campus Security, testified on the nature of security<br />\nduring the Fair. Among the<br />\ntopics discussed were the following possibilities: the re-keying of<br />\nlocks, the hiring of a student<br />\nobservatory force, the restriction<br />\nof live music to the lower quad,<br />\nAt other meetings, we<br />\netc.<br />\nheard from Chris Colombo and<br />\nMary Ellen Porter of the Office<br />\nof Student Services and from<br />\nChris Quinn, John Snyder, et.<br />\nal. of last year's Spring Fair<br />\nBoard. In addition, our subcommittee on the relations between<br />\nthe Spring Fair Board and SAC<br />\ngroups solicited grievances and<br />\nsuggestions from student groups.<br />\nConfidentiality was guaranteed<br />\nto all respondents, and, contrary<br />\nto the implications of your<br />\narticle, all requests for confidentiality were respected.<br />\nBecause the Committee's<br />\nwork is of a sensitive nature,<br />\naccurate reporting, with particular attention to detail, is especially important. We sincerely<br />\nhope that the Committee's report, when published, will receive more careful coverage.<br />\nAd Hoc Committee<br />\non the Spring Fair<br />\nChris Hampton,Chairman<br />\n<br />\nKeep Searching Walt<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nWalter Hook, I'm glad you<br />\nare searching for the real meaning of feminism and don't want<br />\nto accept any old variety. The<br />\nproblem is:<br />\nyou have not<br />\n<br />\ninvented a new feminism; you<br />\nare only parroting what many<br />\nfeminists have been saying for<br />\nyears. Feminists do deal with<br />\nthe issues you address and you<br />\ntheir<br />\ngrossly<br />\nunderestimate<br />\nwork.<br />\nA difficulty with the women's liberation movement is<br />\nthat it encompasses a huge and<br />\nvery diverse group: women. It<br />\nis hard to find issues so universal<br />\nthat they attract support wide<br />\nenough to institute change. The<br />\nmore specific the movement<br />\nbecomes the narrower the support base becomes. There is<br />\ncompromise involved. I do not<br />\nadvocate compromising ideals,<br />\nbut it is unrealistic to talk about<br />\n<br />\nexists now. Sure, the turbulence<br />\nof social change creates new<br />\nproblems and stresses. But what<br />\nmakes you think that living in a<br />\nnon-biological group arrangement is going to make males any<br />\nmore responsive than living in a<br />\nnuclear family? True, it's easier<br />\nto end a relationship if divorce<br />\nisn't involved, but how does<br />\nabolishing marriage qualitatively<br />\nchange the relationships of men<br />\nand women?

The women's<br />\nmovement is not dealing solely<br />\nwith female independence. In<br />\nthe early years of the feminist<br />\nmovement, many women were<br />\nstriving to become what being<br />\nmale stood for. Men symbolized<br />\nfreedom, capability, independence, and privilege. But, as.<br />\nwomen gained more opportunities to imitate men, they realized<br />\nthat manhood was not what<br />\nthey were really after.

Women,<br />\nas a group, have become more<br />\nenlightened about their roles in<br />\nthe last few decades and have<br />\ntaken advantage of many new<br />\nopportunities. They are undergoing drastic changes. This has<br />\nradically altered what it means<br />\nto be a woman. Unfortunately,<br />\nthe role of men has stayed far<br />\nmore rigid. This has created<br />\nstress in male-female relationships regardless of what form<br />\nthey take. That is why changing<br />\ninstitutions is not enough. We<br />\nalso have to change the attitudes<br />\nof the people who comprise the<br />\ninstitutions.

Ronald Reagan's budget cuts nicely<br />\ncomplement \"pro-family\" legislation by making it hard<br />\nfor women to work outside the home. As British<br />\nfeminist Joan Smith points out, women lose in two<br />\nways. First, budget cuts reduce the number and quality<br />\nof government services available to working women such<br />\nas day care and school lunch programs.

Unions can<br />\nprovide working women with a way to organize against<br />\nunsafe working conditions and low wages.<br />\n<br />\nSterilization Abuse<br />\nWomen are also subject to enforced sterilizations,<br />\nof sterilization abuse. This occurs in numerous ways but<br />\nthe most important is probably sterilization through<br />\nunsafe working conditions. One source estimates that<br />\napproximately two million women work in situations<br />\ndangerous to pregnancy and fetal development. These<br />\nusually involve handling suspect chemicals. Thus working women have resorted to union membership as a<br />\nprotection against working conditions that threaten<br />\nsterilization.<br />\n<br />\nmethod for the drug which \"can be offered by paramedical personnel in large-scale sterilization programs.\"<br />\nAnother AID-assisted sterilization program was<br />\nundertaken in Puerto Rico. As Linda Gordon reported<br />\nin Woman's Body, Woman's Right, 35 percent of Puerto<br />\nRican women of childbearing age are sterilized. Further,<br />\ntwo-thirds of them are still in their twenties.<br />\nFeminist activists argue that sterilization abuse is<br />\nlinked to population control and that these practices<br />\nmust be clearly distinguished from birth control. Population control is defined as imposing limits on another<br />\ngroup's fertility and reproduction for the benefit of the<br />\nfirst group. Hence, American feminists insist, they must<br />\nextend their demands to control their own reproductive<br />\nlives to include other women at home and abroad. This<br />\nis especially true for men and women who work in<br />\nlaboratories or health care occupations. They have a<br />\nright to know what chemicals they work with and a<br />\nresponsibility to protect the reproductive rights of<br />\nothers.<br />\n<br />\nBut protections for women workers can also be<br />\nturned against them, however, as a recent case at E.I.<br />\nDuPont Nemours illustrates. The New York Times<br />\nrecently reported that the corporate medical director of<br />\nDuPont appeared before a Congressional subcommittee<br />\nand testified that DuPont exercises special controls<br />\nregarding women workers. They remove women who<br />\nare \"assumed to be fertile\" from workplaces if they<br />\nbelieve that a particular chemical might damage a fetus.<br />\nThus, in the name of safety, many women are barred<br />\nfrom better-paying positions. Those who aren't risk<br />\nsterility. On the job this \"choice\" is called the \"double<br />\nbind.\"<br />\nNonetheless, women are better off wit/z this<br />\nprotection than without it \u2014 much like the ERA. Thus<br />\nworkers have fought vigorously to save OSHA guidelines.<br />\nprotecting their right-to-know what dangerous materials<br />\nor chemicals they may be working with. President<br />\nReagan's Labor Secretary Ray Donovan has killed most of<br />\nthe OSHA regulations. This may force workers to work<br />\nwith dangerous chemicals, and it can force women to<br />\ntake different, perhaps less well-paid positions in work<br />\nareas deemed safe for them. Some women will continue<br />\nto be given the choice of having themselves sterilized or<br />\nface losing their jobs.<br />\n<br />\n\"In one Native American<br />\ntribe in Oklahoma, the<br />\nrate of sterilization of fertile women is over 80<br />\npercent - enough to guar entee that the tribe will<br />\nnot be able to exist past<br />\nanother generation.\"<br />\n<br />\nwomen are employed in service sector jobs funded by<br />\nthe government.

Anna<br />\n(Meryl Streep) mimes an attempt to free<br />\nthe hem of her skirt from a bramble bush,<br />\nwhile in another corner of the room,<br />\nMike (Jeremy Irons) stands waiting.<br />\nAnna looks up suddenly at Mike, her face<br />\nregistering surprise. She starts toward<br />\nhim, stumbles and falls \u2014 and lands, in<br />\nfull costume, on the soft grass of the<br />\nUndercliff at Lyme Regis, as Sarah<br />\nWoodruff, woman of mystery circa 1867,<br />\nand heroine of John Fowles' novel The<br />\nMike,<br />\nFrench Lieutenant's Woman.<br />\nmeanwhile, has likewise metamorphosed<br />\ninto Charles Smithson, Victorian gentleman and paleontologist, and rushes to<br />\nSarah's aid.<br />\nIn the novel, Fowles relates the<br />\nstory of Charles and Sarah's windswept<br />\nromance using the voice of an unquestionably 20th-century narrator, who<br />\nconstantly interrupts the 19th-century<br />\nproceedings with commentary which<br />\nhelps put the story in historical perspective, thereby making the contrasts and<br />\nparallels between the ages as much as part<br />\nof his book as the plot. It is the particular<br />\naccomplishment of screenwriter Harold<br />\nPinter and director Karel Reisz that, in<br />\nbringing The French Lieutenant's Woman<br />\nto the screen, they have captured the<br />\nspirit of Fowles' work by employing a<br />\ncinematic device which achieves,if not an<br />\nidentical, at least a similar, narrative<br />\neffect: the juxtaposition of the Victorian<br />\ntale with the present-day story of an<br />\naffair between the actor and actress who<br />\nare playing Charles and Sarah in a film.<br />\n<br />\nThe period piece is the account of<br />\nCharles' growing infatuation with Sarah, a<br />\nwoman beyond her time, the allure of<br />\nwhose tainted past \u2014 rumor has it that<br />\nshe once had an illicit relationship with a<br />\nyoung French lieutenant \u2014 gradually<br />\nleads him to actions which threaten<br />\nto ruin both his status as gentleman and<br />\nhis prospects for marriage to Ernestina<br />\nFreeman (Lynsey Baxter), the prim<br />\ndaughter Qf a wealthy London businessman. While visiting Ernestina at her<br />\naunt's home in Lyme Regis, a small<br />\nseaport village in the south of England,<br />\nCharles first glimpses Sarah on the Cobb,<br />\na talon-like stone pier which bends<br />\noutward into the English Channel. Sarah<br />\noften stands at the far end of the Cobb,<br />\nstaring across the water \u2014 awaiting, the<br />\ntownspeople say, the return of her<br />\nFrench lieutenant. From the moment<br />\nwhen the startled women tears her gaze<br />\n<br />\nI/\\IR 1 51<br />\nfrom the sea and toward Charles, his<br />\ncuriosity is engaged. And by the time he<br />\nmeets her a second time, while hunting<br />\nfossils on the Undercliff a few days later,<br />\nCharles' fascination with Sarah has<br />\nalready taken on the characteristics<br />\nof an obsession.<br />\nMike, the modern actor, behaves<br />\nat times with typical 20th-century<br />\nmachismo, yet shares this romantic<br />\nsensibility with his Victorian counterpart;<br />\nlikewise Anna, who with her combination<br />\nof flightiness and no-nonsense professionalism possesses nowhere near the melo-<br />\n<br />\nMeryl Streep as Sarah in a pensive moment on the Undercliff<br />\n<br />\nNot Just A Bookstore, It's An Adventure<br />\nBY JOE LEVINE<br />\n\"Actually, the place used to be a<br />\nbeauty parlor,\" said manager Warren<br />\nWigatow, indicating the cavernous interior of the Second Story Book Store with<br />\na single sweep of his hand. \"But things<br />\nwere a little different then. There were a<br />\nlot more sinks.\"<br />\nSinks are perhaps the only weird<br />\nbit of paraphernalia not\u2022in evidence at the<br />\nnewly opened Second Story, located at<br />\n527 North Charles Street, one block<br />\nsouth of the Peabody Conservatory.<br />\nEverything from hand-crafted masks to<br />\nmulti-media art displays in enclosed<br />\nbooths are included in this truly unique<br />\nenterprise. But lest the passing bibliophile write off Second Story as another<br />\ntrendy spin-off of the slick best-seller<br />\nsupermarkets, rest assured: they have<br />\nbooks. Wigatow estimates the store's<br />\n<br />\nSecond Story Books just moments<br />\nbefore another rush of bibliophiles<br />\n<br />\nstock at \"40,000 and climbing,\" and not<br />\nall of these are different-colored editions<br />\nof The World According To Carp.<br />\n\"We're similar to places like the<br />\nGotham in New York,\" Wigatow says,<br />\n\"but with a difference. We're not only for<br />\nthe serious literati.\" He points to a large<br />\nselection of cook books on one wall.<br />\nSerious literati should find their<br />\nneeds amply taken care of, however. In<br />\naddition to a wide range of contemporary<br />\nfiction (one can find works by such<br />\nwriters as Grace Paley, Alice Adams,<br />\nand Hopkins' own Steve Dixon), there is<br />\nan extensive collection titled \"Fine and<br />\nRare Books,\" which contains first editions of Melville, Dickens, and Poe. The<br />\nstore also has what may be the largest<br />\nassortment of small-press poetry in the<br />\ncity.<br />\nFor those of slightly lower brow,<br />\nthere are not only cookbooks, but art<br />\nbooks, how-to paperbacks, and those neat<br />\nlittle flip books which look like old<br />\nmovies when you thumb the pages real<br />\nfast. There i also a large selection of<br />\nscholarly works, and a big .shelf of used<br />\nclassical and jazz records.<br />\nWhile taking in the many aspects<br />\nof Second Story, one gets the idea that<br />\nthis was somebody's brainchild. The<br />\nproud parents are Kirby Malone, arts<br />\ndirector for the store, and owner Allan<br />\nStypek.<br />\n\"We're trying to be a major<br />\ncontemporary arts center,\" he said. \"We<br />\nwant this to be the kind of place that<br />\npeople coming from Europe and the West<br />\nCoast know about and plan to visit.\"<br />\nIt's too early to assess quality, but<br />\nif variety and novelty alone are sufficient<br />\nindication, Malone may not be pipedreaming. Second Story has a video and<br />\nfilm theater, a musical performance stage,<br />\nand space for fiction and poetry readings<br />\n(William Burroughs will be reading there<br />\nin November).<br />\nMalone himself will<br />\nparticipate next Wednesday in an ongoing<br />\n<br />\ndramatic solemnity of Sarah, still has in<br />\ncommon with her character a muted yet<br />\nvigorous sensuality. While Mike and<br />\nAnna's relationship is not detailed with<br />\nnearly as much care as Charles and<br />\nSarah's (all told, it takes up only about a<br />\nquarter of the film's running time), the<br />\nsimilarities between the two stories create<br />\na surprising amount of dramatic friction,<br />\nand raise more than a few questions<br />\nabout the nature of love and romance as<br />\nmanifested in our own age as well as in<br />\nthe 19th century.<br />\nThis, more than<br />\nanything else, is the greatest strength of<br />\nThe French Lieutenant's Woman.<br />\nIt is by no means the film's only<br />\nstrength. Director Reisz and cinematographer Freddie Francis have given<br />\ntheir movie, especially in the Victorian<br />\nsequences, a striking visual beauty:<br />\nbrilliant green countrysides and slate-grey \u2022<br />\nseascapes, slick moonlit cobblestone<br />\nstreets and sitting-rooms filled with<br />\ntapestries, brass, and varnished wood.<br />\nThe music, by Carl Davis, is richly evocative, always staying just this side of<br />\nschmaltz. Pinter's screenplay remains<br />\nclear and concise even as it jumps back<br />\nand forth between the centuries. The<br />\nsupporting actors \u2014 particularly Leo<br />\nMcKern, as a Lyme physician; Hilton<br />\nMcRae, as Sam, Charles' manservant;<br />\nPatience Collier, as Mrs. Poulteney,<br />\nSarah's employer; David Warner, as a<br />\nmagistrate; and Penelope Wilton, as the<br />\nwife of Mike, the actor \u2014 provide finely<br />\ntuned portraits of minor characters<br />\nwhich, in the hands of less skilled performers, might otherwise have come off<br />\nas simple stereotypes.<br />\nMeryl Streep acquits herself well<br />\nin the difficult dual roles of Sarah and<br />\nAnna, but it is Jeremy limns' impassioned<br />\nrenderings of Charles and Mike which<br />\nultimately give the film its power, most<br />\nnotably in its final scenes. Irons captures<br />\nadmirably in Charles the dilemma of a<br />\nman forced by the dictates of society to<br />\nbury his sexuality under a heap of carefully cultivated gentlemanly attributes,<br />\nand as Mike he sketches the almost<br />\nimperceptible suffering of a man not<br />\nquite sure how to balance his longings<br />\nagainst the ever-shifting loyalties of the<br />\nelusive Modern Woman. Irons' sensitive<br />\nperformance ties the narrative threads of<br />\nThe French Lieutenant's Woman together, and reminds us that the pursuit of<br />\nlove was never any less difficult in ages<br />\npast than it is today.<br />\n<br />\nmulti-media performance series at the<br />\nstore.<br />\nThe arts center grew out of<br />\nMalone's work with two Baltimore arts<br />\nand performance groups, BaltiMedia and<br />\nDesire Productions.

They have produced<br />\nmulti-media shows at School 33, the<br />\nCharles Theatre, and the Glass Pavilion<br />\nhere at Hopkins. It was, in fact, a group<br />\nof some 20 artists from the two groups<br />\nwho did the actual renovation work on<br />\nthe interior of Second Story Books.<br />\n\"This all came about as a result of<br />\nmy asking for a part-time job here originally,\" Malone said. \"I got to know Allan,<br />\nand one night I said, just joking really,<br />\n'Wouldn't it be great to turn this into a<br />\nmulti-arts center?'

Last week it was<br />\npenalties. No one can say that<br />\nJohns Hopkins is playing perfect<br />\nfootball, but the last two weeks<br />\nhave produced two victories<br />\nthat allow the Blue Jays to take<br />\na -winning record (3-2) up to<br />\nLebanon Valley tomorrow.<br />\nFor both teams in tomorrow's contest, 1981 has been a<br />\nstep upward. The Flying Dutchmen, winless in 1980, have<br />\nbeaten Swarthmore and Ursinus.<br />\nAs for the Jays, they avenged a<br />\n1980 loss for the second consecutive week. With the defense<br />\nand special teams again producing opportunities and the offense coming back from the<br />\ndead, the Jays put away Ursinus<br />\n21-7.<br />\nIt may well have been the<br />\nJays' best game of the season.<br />\nThe Jay defense put on its<br />\nfourth strong performance of<br />\nthe year and has now allowed<br />\nonly 12 points per game. The<br />\nJays picked up 23 first downs to<br />\nnine for the Grizzly Bears. Not<br />\nonly did Hopkins outgain<br />\nUrsinus 349-164 in total offense,<br />\nbut half of the entire Bear<br />\nproduction<br />\nwas<br />\noffensive<br />\nchurned out in a single pass. So<br />\ndominant was the Hopkins defense that the Bears did not<br />\nmanage a first down until the<br />\n<br />\n7:13 mark of the second quarter<br />\nand did not get inside the<br />\nHopkins 30 until six minutes<br />\nremained in the game.<br />\nBut it almost turned out to<br />\nbe a tale of missed opportunities, as was the case at Swarth-<br />\n<br />\nscore. \"Whether it was a confidence factor or what, I can't<br />\nput my finger on it, but I was<br />\nhappy with the improvement,\"<br />\nsaid coach Jerry Pfeifer.

After a twoame hiatus, Stromber a ain<br />\n<br />\nJack Flynn averaged 38.2<br />\nyards on five punts to give a<br />\nboost to his average, and the<br />\nJays again did much to diminish<br />\ntheir opponent's average by<br />\nblocking their second punt in<br />\nthree games, which more importantly set up the Jays' first<br />\nscore. A host of Jay rushers<br />\noverwhelmed Bear punter Alan<br />\nChester early in the third period<br />\nand smothered the kick; Jamie<br />\nEdwards picked up the loose ball<br />\nat the Bear 30 and ran it down<br />\nto the six.<br />\nLeast encouraging proved to<br />\nbe the quarterback protection,<br />\nwhich had been exceptional<br />\nup to that point. The Ursinus<br />\ndefensive line, led by Jim Kelly<br />\nand Mark Schmidt, nailed Jim<br />\nMargraff behind the line of<br />\nscrimmage ten times. The Jays<br />\ntwice penetrated the Bear 20 in<br />\nthe first half. The first drive,<br />\ncoming on a 28-yard pass to<br />\nStromberg, was halted by a sack.<br />\nzr. The second, in which the Jays<br />\ngot to the Ursinus 14 in the final<br />\nminute of the half, was snuffed<br />\nout when Kelly smothered<br />\nMargraff from behind for a<br />\nten-yard loss.<br />\n<br />\nMargraff scrambles out of the pocket<br />\nmore.

There's no excuse for<br />\nthis, since schedules are available<br />\nmonths in advance.<br />\nBut what if the assassin<br />\narrives at the sport event on<br />\ntime? It's not easy to conceal a<br />\nshotgun or dart gun in a crowd<br />\nof 20,000, sighting the sights<br />\nalthough they should've been<br />\nsighted before the impending<br />\nassassinatiort, revealing the guns<br />\nso that.no one else knows that<br />\na gun will be fired shortly, taking<br />\naim and then firing as if he were<br />\njust eating a hotdog and sipping<br />\na beer without spilling any on<br />\nthe child sitting next to him,<br />\nthereby not arousing his suspi-<br />\n<br />\ncion, for he doesn't want anyone<br />\nto know that he is responsible<br />\nfor the dead guy on the field \u2014<br />\nthat's only if he manages to get a<br />\nround off before the guy in<br />\nfront of him stands up and<br />\napplauds a 8-3-8 triple play with<br />\nthe shortstop playing out on the<br />\noutfield grass with one out.<br />\nBaseball assassinations are<br />\neasy unless the targeted 'player<br />\nruns a 4.4 forty and plays<br />\ncenterfield although the opportune moment to assassinate is<br />\nwhen a ball has a hang time of<br />\nmore than ten seconds and floats<br />\nthrough the air with a guy on<br />\nthird waiting to score when<br />\nthe guy in center, although he<br />\ncan be in right, catches the ball<br />\nunless the assassin has fired his<br />\nweapon prematurely; it's the<br />\nbest time because every one is<br />\neither watching the guy on third<br />\nor the guy in center waiting for<br />\nthe ball that he must release and<br />\nthrow immediatly if he wants to<br />\nwin the game, for the winning<br />\nrun is on third and the assassin<br />\nknows this and has bet heavily<br />\non the game with his bookie<br />\nwho happens to be his employer.<br />\nAs I was saying, baseball<br />\nassassinations are difficult compared with golf assassinations<br />\nbecause golfers are stupid and<br />\nare easy prey for the sporting<br />\nassassin, who stands in the<br />\ngalley or behind one of the trees<br />\nin the forest waiting for his<br />\nfavorite golfer to slice or hook;<br />\nit all depends on what side of<br />\nthe fairway the tree is located<br />\non, because the assassin doesn't<br />\nwant to kill any caddies who are<br />\nunemployed Monday, Tuesday,<br />\nand Wednesday while the golfers<br />\ntravel and clean their clubs on<br />\ntheir off days, so it's important<br />\nthat the assassin be positioned<br />\n<br />\nperfectly for the kill because he<br />\nhates golf and likes blue-collar<br />\nworkers.<br />\nBut sports assassins aren't<br />\nthat bad; they're athletes in the<br />\ntruest sense because they hunt<br />\nfellow athletes who are boring to<br />\nwatch while the assassin's exploits are exciting and different<br />\nto witness when and if assassinations do occur, for it costs more<br />\nto attend a sporting event<br />\nthan to attend a political rally<br />\nwhere they don't mind shooting<br />\nnon-athletes who are only athletic when they are being covered<br />\nby the press.<br />\n<br />\nshowing: \"The officiating left a<br />\nlot to be desired.

They<br />\nwere asked to contribute their<br />\nideas so that the Young Democrats will have a better idea as to<br />\nwhat planks in their platform<br />\nneed revision.<br />\nEach of the nine witnesses<br />\nwas given a set time to issue his<br />\nor her statement, and then<br />\nreceived questions from. the<br />\npanel:<br />\nBrett Weiss, Charles<br />\nKruzansky, Leonard Lucci, Greg<br />\nPecararo, and Vincent De Marco.<br />\nCharlie King of Americans<br />\nfor Democratic Action said<br />\nliberals are in the process of<br />\nreassessment, and thus should<br />\nsteer their interests towards the<br />\ngoals of education for all, and<br />\nthe availability of financial aid<br />\nfor those who cannot afford<br />\nhigher education. He said \"an<br />\neducation process needs to take<br />\nplace\" in regard to Reaganomics<br />\nand seemed worried about<br />\n\"President Reagan's retrenchment on civil rights.\"<br />\nThis was also the concern of<br />\nLaura Murphy of the American<br />\nCivil Liberties Union. Murphy<br />\nconcentrated mostly on the<br />\nVoting Rights Act, which is up<br />\nfor reassessment, and how this<br />\nreassessment was seen as a<br />\n\"structural attack on amendments to the Constitution.\"<br /><br />\nAt the present, several mostly<br />\nsouthern states are covered by<br />\nthe act. The Justice Department<br />\nreviews all laws passed within<br />\nthese states to make sure they<br />\nare not discriminatory. Brett<br />\nWeiss, chairman of the hearing,<br />\nfound it \"ironic\" that such a<br />\nsubstantial piece of legislation is<br />\nup for reassessment.<br />\nOne key issue for the Young<br />\nDemocrats seems to be the<br />\nrecruitment of minorities into<br />\nthe party. Charlie King suggested that blacks are disenchanted<br />\nwith the party but offered<br />\nanother problem in their recruitment: if you seek out minorities, you will seem paternalistic;<br />\nif you ignore them, you are<br />\nracist.<br />\nGeorge Bunt of the NAACP<br />\nDemocrats<br />\nwas emphatic:<br />\nshould go \"back to a party of<br />\ncompassion\" and \"stop trying to<br />\nout-Reagan Reagan.\" His major<br />\nconcerns centered on cuts in<br />\nassistance programs such as job<br />\ntraining, education, food, especially for children, and affirmative action. He said the only<br />\nway to interest minorities in the<br />\nDemocratic Party again is to<br />\nsupport programs that will appeal to them. Murphy agreed,<br />\nobserving that the people do<br />\nnot participate because they do<br />\nnot believe the system works for<br />\nthem.<br />\nThree other key issues were<br />\ndiscussed: nuclear power, the<br />\nFamily Protection Act and abortion. On the latter subject, three<br />\npeople testified: Professor Chris<br /><br />\nWilliams of the National Lawyers Guild, Joseph McPherson of<br />\nMaryland Right to Life, and<br />\nSteve Rivilus of Planned Parenthood of Maryland.<br />\nWilliams concentrated on<br />\nthe Family Protection Act currently being sponsored in Congress, which has sometimes been<br />\ncalled the \"right-wing shopping<br />\nlist.\"<br />\nThe act's provisions<br />\ninclude \"an all-out attack on<br />\ngay/lesbian citizens,\" and tax<br />\nincentives for households which<br />\ncontain aged people. Such an<br />\nincentive is seen as a means of<br />\nkeeping the family a unit.<br />\nActually, according to Williams,<br />\nthis would be a burden to the<br />\nfamily, keeping a family member<br />\n\u2014 most likely the woman \u2014 at<br />\nhome to care for the aged one.<br />\nThis, said Williams, is the intent<br />\nof the sponsors, who want to<br />\ndeny women their rights, and is<br />\n\"an effort to legalize government intrusion into areas of<br />\nprivate choice.., in the right-wing<br />\nconservative tradition.\"<br />\nJoseph McPherson presented a different perspective. He<br />\nsees the 1973 Supreme Court<br />\nruling in favor of abortion as an<br />\n\"attack upon human dignity,\"<br />\nadding that it is \"an exercise<br />\nin raw judicial power.\" By such<br />\nmeasures, he believes our government \"loses its moral authority.\" McPherson then argued<br />\nthat because society loses its<br />\nrespect for itself, weapon production and economic stimulation occur. When questioned, he<br />\nexplained that once a healthy<br /><br />\nfamily life has been lost, material goods become more important; hence, the economy is<br />\nstimulated.<br />\nHe offered no<br />\nevidence to back up his theory.<br />\nSteve Rivilus, Public Affairs<br />\nDirector of Planned Parenthood,<br />\nfollowed McPherson. He told<br />\nthe panel that the \"Democrats<br />\nshould regroup\" to protect the<br />\nrights of the poor, minorities,<br />\nwomen, and aged. Strongly<br />\nopposed to any restriction of<br />\nreproductive freedom, Rivilus<br />\nsaid that since there is no right<br />\ndecision for all women on<br />\nabortion, \"then government<br />\nmust never interfere\" with these<br />\nrights. He cited a poll taken<br />\nrecently which found that 90<br />\npercent of the U.S. population<br />\nfavored<br />\nlegalized<br />\nabortion<br />\nwhereas a relatively minor 10<br />\npercent were against it. This, he<br /><br />\nbelieves, is proof that the<br />\nMoral Majority is not nearly as<br />\nrepresentative of the population<br />\nas first believed. Rivilus also told<br />\nthe panel that they should apply<br />\ntheir efforts to the Medicaid<br />\nbenefits which are available for<br />\nabortions only when a woman's<br />\nlife is endangered.<br />\nRandall of the Professional<br />\nNuclear Society said at the start<br />\nof his testimony that he did not<br />\nbelieve nuclear power should be<br />\na partisan issue. He noted that,<br />\nat the present, nuclear power in<br />\nthe U.S. produces as much<br />\nenergy as is shipped down<br />\nthrough the Alaskan Pipeline, or<br />\n1.5 million barrels of oil a day.<br />\nThirty-three licenses are in the<br />\nprocess of being issued to build<br />\nnuclear power plants across the<br />\ncountry, and by 1985 they<br />\ncont. on p. 7<br /><br />\nA<br />\nInternational Begins<br />\nRecruitment Effort At JHU<br />\ncont. from p.1<br />\nAI-JHU will be writing<br />\nletters on the Mykaylenko case<br />\nin addition to its usual \"urgent<br />\naction\" letters.

It wasn't<br />\nthe opinion advocated a few weeks ago in<br />\nthis column, but that's not the issue.<br />\nObviously, most of you don't want plus/<br />\nminus grading, and if 63 percent of you<br />\nwere concerned enough to do anything<br />\naround here, we applaud the spirit and<br />\nrespect the goal.<br />\nUnfortunately, it appears as if the<br />\nadministration isn't going to view things<br />\nthis way. Dean of Graduate and Undergraduate Studies Michael Hooker has predicted<br />\nthat the Academic -Council is going to<br />\nignore the fact- that this was the largest<br />\nstudent-voter turnout in many years, and<br />\nstick with plus/minus grading anyway.<br />\nSurprise, surprise. But wait \u2014 this is really<br /><br />\nuncalled-for hostility that you<br />\nhave shown.<br />\nSomewhere in the last third<br />\nof your article, you envision a<br />\nnon-biological family consisting<br />\nof'intimate friends. Pairs of the<br />\nmembers might be .married or<br />\nnot.

It is not,<br />\nhowever, a new idea; in the<br />\n'60s and early '70s, it was<br />\ncalled the commune and the<br />\nconcept of communal living is<br />\nmuch older than that.<br />\nMore important, the alternative family you present is<br />\nnot any less likely to become<br />\nmale-dominated than the nuccont. on p. 5<br /><br />\na little worse than previous instances where<br />\nthe administration has completely disregarded the students' wishes. This time,<br />\nthey actually went through the charade of<br />\nsaying they wanted to measure student<br />\nopinion before implementing a change that<br />\nwill affect only students.<br />\nIf 93 percent of the largest studentvoter turnout isn't a clear enough expression of student opinion, than nothing ever<br />\nwill be. It's becoming increasingly obvious<br />\nthat, on serious matters where a real<br />\ndifference of opinion between students and<br />\nadministration is at stake, the administration can and will override all objections. If<br />\nthey override this one, they might as well<br />\nabolish the Student Council and all other<br />\nforms of democratic expression around<br />\nhere. It's just a charade, anyway, so why<br />\njerk us around?<br /><br />\nLetters to the Editor<br />\nsupport, or to do the job that<br />\nthe professor was too lazy to<br />\nperform.

I<br />\ncan see no point in doing this<br />\nbeyond, perhaps, the first paragraph. It is obvious that Hook is<br /><br />\nWomen Want Families, Too<br />\ncont. from p. 4<br />\nlear family. Then is no inherent<br />\nquality in comn anal living that<br />\nmakes it less s,2xist than any<br />\n3ther type of gn,aping. It is the<br />\nindividuals in a group who<br />\ndetermine its sexist or non-sexist<br />\nnature. For this reason, the<br />\nbiological family need not be<br />\nmale-dominated either.<br />\nEqual rights for men and<br />\nwomen does not have to destroy<br />\nthe institution of marriage. You<br />\nmake the valid points that<br />\n\"male-female relationships are<br />\nchanging fundamentally\" and<br />\nthat \"marriage used to be a<br />\npower relationship.\" These are<br />\nnot reasons, however, for abandoning marriage. As relationships between men and women<br />\nmove increasingly toward greater<br />\nequality, marriage will cease to<br />\nbe a power relationship based on<br />\nmale domination.<br />\nIt is not clear to me what<br />\nyour opinion of marriage is.<br />\nThough you mention that some<br />\nmembers of a<br />\nnon-biological<br />\nfamily might be married, you<br />\nvisualize them leaving the family<br />\nfreely. You seem to be confusing marriage with temporary<br />\nrelationships. The only distinction marriage holds among other<br />\nrelationships is its permanence.<br />\nAnd be realistic: the abandoned<br />\nspouse and children you mention are going to feel just as<br />\nemotionally hurt as in the<br />\nbiological family.<br />\nYou have already stated<br />\nthat biological parents are ultimately responsible for their<br />\nchildren, but you have them<br />\ncarelessly leaving the family<br />\nwithout guilt. Suppose both<br />\nbiological parents decide to cut<br />\nout; at what point does this<br />\nfreedom begin to be traded<br />\nChildren,<br />\nfor responsibility?<br />\nbecause they are no selfneed<br />\npermanent<br />\nsufficient,<br />\nparents. The nuclear family is<br />\nthe best menas that has been<br />\nfound for providing this because<br />\nit is based on the permanence of<br />\nmarriage.<br /><br />\nYou have brought up an<br />\ninteresting alternative to marriage, but it is not a practical<br />\nsolution for everyone, specifically not for those with children. Though a nuclear family<br />\nmight be incorporated into the<br />\nextended family you have described, parents could not enjoy<br />\nthe freedom you encourage. In<br />\nthe end, there must remain a<br />\nnuclear family.<br />\nAlso, I do not understand<br />\nthe link you have made between equality of rights and a<br />\nneed for non-biological families.<br />\nThe conflict you describe between self-sufficiency and isolation is not new, as you demonstrate by citing Aristotle. The<br />\nbenefits of increased interaction<br />\nand affection found in an<br />\nextended, non-biological family<br />\nare not related to the benefits<br />\nof equality.<br />\nSome of the other arguments you use to support<br />\nyour argument are just as<br />\nspuriously linked. You have a<br />\ngood idea, but you do not need<br />\nto prove it is a cure-all. The<br />\nnon-biological family is not<br /><br />\ngoing to end unemployment<br />\nand prejudice against homosexuality. I wish a single answer<br />\ncould end all of our problems<br />\ntoo, but there is no such solution.<br />\nFinally, the way in which<br />\nyou have written your article<br />\nultimately reveals a hostility<br />\nwhich is unwarranted. \"Feminism, when limited to ideas of<br />\nself-sufficiency, must ultimately<br />\nbe described as bourgeois, aiding<br />\nthe bourgeoisie and ultimately<br />\nharming most women and men.\"<br />\nWait a minute: what are you<br />\ntalking about here? Since when<br />\nhas feminism been limited to<br />\nideas .of self-sufficiency? Selfsufficiency is the ability to<br />\nsurvive alone.. Few want to<br />\nlive a life alone and isolated,<br />\nbut in case of tragedy everyone<br />\nneeds this ability.<br />\nRight?<br />\nWhere have you heard feminists, or any one else, advocating<br />\nisolation?

I suppose<br />\nhis state of mind can be used as<br />\nan excuse for his review; it does<br />\nnot, however, excuse the staff<br /><br />\nof the News-Letter for printing<br />\nhis article.<br />\nMark Hughes<br /><br />\nYou Blew It, N-L<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nInitially distressed by the<br />\nNews-Letter's lack of coverage<br />\ncont. on p. 9<br /><br />\nThe Outside World<br />\nThe Same Old Boss<br />\nBY BRIAN MIRSKY<br />\nAfter the election of President Reagan and the purported<br />\ntakeover of the House and<br />\nSenate by the forces of the<br />\n\"New Right.\" traditional liberals<br />\nwithin and without this university underwent a severe depression followed by near panic and<br />\npredictions of enforced moraliunemployment,<br />\nty, massive<br />\nreinstatement of the draft, and<br />\neven of warfare between the rich<br />\nand the poor. In reality such<br />\ndire premonitions have not materialized; this article was written while I was at my workstudy job at the circulation desk,<br />\nnot in a plane en route to El<br />\nSalvador. At the same time the<br />\nRepublican claims of balanced<br />\nbudgets, tax cuts, substantial<br />\nincreases in defense appropriations, increased productivity and<br />\nlower interest and inflation<br />\nrates show few signs of successful implementation, at least in<br />\nthe short run. With nearly a<br />\nyear having passed since the<br />\n1980 elections, the social and<br />\npolitical effects of the GOP<br />\nvictories seein far less profound<br />\nthan many feared.<br />\ngovernmental<br />\nRadical<br />\nchanges are not in the works.<br />\nOne characteristic of the massive<br />\nbureaucracy of the. United States<br />\nis its fondness for the status quo.<br />\nJust as the progressive social and<br />\ncivil rights changes were hard<br />\nfought and slow in coining in the<br />\n'50s and '60s, and conservative<br />\nencroachment on these principles will likely be similarly<br />\ndifficult to enact. We find that<br />\nReagan's 30 percent across-theboard tax cuts became 25<br /><br />\npercent<br />\n\"sort-of-across-theboard\" tax cuts, and the likelihood of increased taxes in other<br />\nareas and delays in the enactment of the third-year cuts is<br />\nquite high; a 7 percent real<br />\ngrowth rate in military spending<br />\nis quickly beginning to look very<br />\nmuch like the Carter defense<br />\nrequests; the new 12 percent<br />\nbudget cuts have received nearly<br />\nunanimous disapproval; and just<br />\nthis past week the minimum<br />\n$122 monthly social security<br />\nbenefits were restored.<br />\nIn fact, the only areas in<br />\nwhich dramatic deviations in<br />\npolicy are still being pursued are<br />\nin the Department of Interior<br />\nand Environmental Protection<br />\nAgency. But, again such changes<br />\nare destined to failure. Only<br />\nMuammar Qadafi is less popular<br />\nthan James Watt and even the<br />\nRepublican chairman of the<br />\nEnvironment and Public Works<br />\nCommittee has all but called for<br />\nthe resignation of the chair:<br />\nwoman of the EPA. Hence, it<br />\nshould be quite obvious that a<br />\ntrue reversal of government<br />\npolicies is not forthcoming.<br />\nA few political predictions<br />\nthus become possible. The only<br />\ncases of dramatic political<br />\nrealignments in this country<br />\nhave come about from a single<br />\nparty's ability to confront successfully the issues of the day<br />\nwhile the other party howls in<br />\nprotest (e.g. the Democrats'<br />\nestablishment of relief programs<br />\nduring the Depression over the<br />\nopposition of the Republicans).<br />\nThis is not the case today.

Eisenhower Library on \"The Iranian RevoluLessons for America.\"<br />\ntion:<br />\nThe lecture took place in the<br />\nGarrett Room, as part of the<br />\nWednesday Noon Series.<br />\n\"A major lesson for Amerithe Iranian crisis is that<br />\nfrom<br />\nca<br />\nwe must deal with oppressive<br />\nregimes without becoming identified with them,\" Kennedy<br />\nasserted early in his speech.<br />\nKennedy pointed out America's heavy involvement with the<br />\nShah of Iran. The United States<br />\nmade large arms deals, and set<br />\nup massive communications networks. Yet many villages did<br />\nnot even have roads.<br /><br />\nMoorhead Kennedy describes lessons of hostage experience.<br /><br />\n\"While we placed many<br />\ndemands on the Shah,\" he<br />\nexplained, \"he placed some<br />\ndemands on us. We were forced<br />\nto support him.<br />\nWhen he<br />\ncreated a police state, it was<br />\nidentified with the United<br />\nStates.\"<br />\nKennedy feels that our<br /><br />\nBustamante Speaks On Mexico<br />\ncont..from p. 1<br />\nA pattern of pejorative<br />\ndistinctions between old and new immigrants developed, according to Bustamante, resulting<br />\nin a mechanism of division<br />\nbetween old and new, preventing<br />\nsolidarity between the two<br />\ngroups and obscuring the fundamental problems of American<br />\nsociety.<br />\nThe economic expansion of<br />\nthe Southwest during the early<br />\n20th century created a demand<br />\nfor cheap imported foreign<br />\nlabor. The first U.S. policy of<br />\nrectuitment of Mexican workers<br />\nbegan at this time. The U.S.<br />\ncontinues to recruit Mexican<br />\nWorkers during periods of expansion.<br />\nThere are two important<br />\ndifferences between Mexican<br />\nand European immigrants. Mexican immigration is both a<br />\ncontinuous and temporary phenomenon. Most Mexican workers<br />\nreturn to their native country,<br />\nand they continue to be replaced<br />\nin the U.S. by new Mexican<br />\nimmigrants.<br />\nThe \"structural dimension\"<br />\nof Mexican immigration which<br /><br />\nresponds to the international<br />\nlabor market is quite different<br />\nfrom the \"perceptual dimension\" of immigration which<br />\nchanges according to conditions<br />\nof expansion and recession in<br />\nthe United States.<br />\nBlaming Mexican immigrants for problems in unemployment, public health and<br />\npublic education reflect a negative \"perceptual dimension.\"<br />\nThis occurs during recessionary<br />\nperiods.<br />\nThe benefits of importing<br />\n\"human energy from Mexico\"<br />\nare several. Employers find that<br />\nMexican immigrants reduce their<br />\ncosts of - production. The U.S.<br />\neconomy does not have to bear<br />\nthe costs of producing or reproducing the labor force because<br />\nof the temporary nature of<br />\nMexican immigration.<br />\nAny attempt to control<br />\nimmigration is unrealistic because, according to Bustamante,<br />\nthe United States needs Mexican<br />\nlabor to fill jobs in the service<br />\nsector. These immigrants are<br />\nnot competing with the unemployed because they take posi-<br /><br />\nNOW Sponsors Walk<br />\nFor ERA Ratification<br />\ncont. from p. 2<br />\nBecause of federal law, the<br />\nERA \u2014 which states, \"Equality<br />\nof rights under the law shall<br />\nnot be denied or abridged by the<br />\nUnited States or by any state on<br />\naccount of sex\" \u2014 will have<br />\nto be ratified by June 1, 1982.<br />\nIf three more states do not ratify<br />\nthe amendment, then the entire<br />\nlengthy procedure would have to<br />\nbegin again. Duke predicted<br />\nthat ratification by 38 states<br />\n\"would take at least another 20<br />\nyears\" due to the more conservative character of Congress and a<br /><br />\nlarge proportion of state legislatures.<br />\nCampus Walk-a-Thon organizers hope enough Hopkins<br />\nstudents will turn out Saturday<br />\nto walk as one group. The walk,<br />\nwhich will begin with many<br />\npro-ERA speeches, will take<br />\nparticipants from the Inner<br />\nHarbor, through South Baltimore, Federal Hill, and then<br />\nback to the Inner Harbor for an<br />\nafternoon celebration. All participants are urged to wear green<br />\nand white to show their support<br />\nfor the ERA.<br /><br />\ntions no one wants. Proposed<br />\nreforms of immigration laws<br />\nare \"political solutions to politically defined problems,\" Bustamante said.<br />\nThe geographical vicinity of<br />\nMexico to the U.S. cannot be<br />\navoided. The \"border has too<br />\nmany holes,\" said Bustamante.<br />\nMexican society permeates the<br />\nU.S. and U.S. society permeates<br />\nMexico. According to Bustamante, \"We just have to find a<br />\nway to learn how to live together.\"<br />\nIn response to .a question<br />\nBustamante said that \"it would<br />\nbe a problem, but not a catastrophe\" if the U.S. closed the<br />\nborders. The growth rate of the<br />\nMexican economy (twice that of<br />\nthe U.S.), combined with the oil<br />\nbonanza, will eventually find the<br />\nMexican employer competing<br />\nwith the U.S. employer for the<br />\nsame labor.<br />\nWhen asked<br />\nwhat he<br />\nthought about the exploitation<br />\nof Mexican workers in the U.S.,<br />\nBustamante responded that \"we<br />\nwould be totally in favor\" of<br />\nbetter treatment, but that if<br />\nsomehow immigrants without<br />\ndocuments had the same rights<br />\nas other workers, the demand<br />\nfor them would shrink.<br />\nJHU Social Relations Professor Alejandro Portes remarked that Bustamante's presentation was \"novel,\" \"wellresearched\" and provided a view<br />\ndistinct from what is seen in the<br />\nAmerican press and the public<br />\npronouncements of the U.S.<br />\ngovernment.<br />\nPortes agreed with \"about<br />\nthree quarters\" of the speech.<br />\nHe feels that it is premature to<br />\nsay that immigration does not<br />\nrepresent an important safety<br />\nvalve for Mexico. He is somewhat less enthusiastic than Bustamante about the prospects for<br />\nthe Mexican economy.<br /><br />\nsuffers myopia<br />\ngovernment<br />\nwhen it comes to foreign affairs.<br />\nWe Were more concerned with<br />\nselling a certain number of<br />\nplanes to Iran in one year than<br />\nwith where Iran was being led,<br />\nhe said.<br />\nPart of the problem lies in<br />\nthe structure of the Foreign<br />\nService itself. Foreign diplomats<br />\nhave a term of three years, and<br />\nthus must prove their worth in<br />\nthat relatively short period of<br />\ntime.<br />\nKennedy does not think<br />\nthat this problem is unique to<br />\nthe Foreign Service. \"Americans<br />\nsuffer from shortsightedness.<br />\nWe see that Detroit is suffering<br />\nfinancially, while the Japanese<br />\nautomakers are succeeding. This<br />\nis because the Japanese had the<br />\nforesight to look ahead.\"<br />\n\"I wonder what we learned<br />\nfrom Iran?\" Kennedy asked. He<br />\nfears that the U.S. may haite<br />\nlearned little, as exemplified by<br />\nthe reaction to Sadat's assassination. Reagan sent three presidents as a show of support, but<br />\nhe never addressed the question<br />\nof why the assassination occurred.<br />\n\"We made the Shah our<br />\npuppet, and now what are doing<br />\nto Egypt's President Mubarak?\"<br />\nhe questioned. \"I don't think<br />\nthat we're helping Mubarak.\"<br />\nReligion plays a major role<br />\nin these Arabic countries,<br />\nKennedy pointed out.<br />\nHe<br />\nbelieves that the Arabs are<br />\ndisillusioned with the political<br />\nideas, communism and all the<br />\nother \"\u2014isms.\" Thus, they turn<br />\nto Islam.<br />\nKennedy hopes that his<br />\nchurch, the Cathedral Church of<br />\nSt. John Divine in New York,<br />\nwill raise the question of how<br />\nreligion is tied with foreign<br />\naffairs.<br />\n\"We've got to understand<br />\nhow religion is working in these<br />\nother countries,\" he stressed.<br />\n\"We see this in Poland. Do you<br />\nthink that the Polish people<br />\ncould be as strong as they are<br />\nwithout religion?\"<br />\nKennedy then applied these<br />\nsituations abroad to America.<br />\nHe observed that the Moral<br />\nMajority institutions are churning out video messages, much<br />\nlike Khomeini did in Iran. He<br />\nfeels that we must examine the<br />\nsimilarities.<br /><br />\n\"We need to look ahead at<br />\nour own value structure. I hope<br />\nthat my church will address the<br />\nquestion of where we are going,<br />\nand what we want. I hope that<br />\nthis will be a lesson from Iran,\"<br />\nhe concluded.<br />\nKennedy was then asked<br />\nquestions from the large audience, most of which pertained to<br />\nhis experiences as a hostage.<br />\nWhen asked why the hostage crisis occurred, Kennedy<br />\nresponded that the American<br />\ndiplomats did not have a good<br />\nrelationship with the students<br />\nand clergymen. He explained<br />\nthat \"American diplomats only<br />\nsee the elite, not the common<br />\npeople.\"<br />\nHe told of how one of his<br />\ncaptors asked him why the<br />\ndiplomats had not known that<br />\nthe Iranians were going to take<br />\nover the embassy, when every<br />\nchild in Tehran knew it beforehand.<br />\nKennedy later spoke of a<br />\nmock execution, in which he<br />\nand several other hostages were<br />\nstripped naked and then lined up<br />\nagainst a wall.<br />\nWhen asked about the rescue attempt, Kennedy said that<br />\nhe would never have planned it.<br />\nThe hostages did not learn of the<br />\nattempt until three weeks afterwards.<br />\n\"I lived from day to day as<br />\na hostage,\" he responded to a<br />\nquestion on how he coped in<br />\ncaptivity, \"which is the only<br />\nway to live. When the cook<br />\nmade lasagna, that was a good<br />\nday; when we were given showers, that was a good day.\"<br />\nKennedy was then asked if<br />\nthe news media had overemphasized the hostage crisis. \"Even<br />\nthough it might seem that the<br />\nmedia overplayed the hostage<br />\nsituation, it did show the rest of<br />\nthe world that we are a nation<br />\nthat cares,\" he concluded.<br />\nKennedy received his J.D.<br />\ndegree from Harvard Law School<br />\nin 1959. In 1960 he entered the<br />\nU.S. Foreign Service and went<br />\non to serve in Yemen, Greece,<br />\nLebanon, and several other<br />\ncountries. He was assigned to<br />\nTehran in 1979. At the time of<br />\nthe American Embassy takeover,<br />\nhe was acting as economic<br />\ncounsellor. He has written a<br />\nbook relating his experiences as<br />\nan Iranian hostage, which is soon<br />\nto be published.<br /><br />\nYoung Democrats Hold<br />\nPublic Forum At JHU<br />\ncont. from O. 3<br />\ncould be producing more than<br />\n50 percent of the nation's<br />\nenergy.<br />\nThe panel's major question<br />\nwas about nuclear waste.<br />\nRandall said high-level waste,<br />\nwhich is the major cause for<br />\nconcern, is a small fraction of<br />\nwhat is actually considered<br />\nwaste. Of 100 units of fuel, two<br />\nunits are high-level waste; the<br />\nrest can be recycled and used in<br />\nthe plant again.

Empowered to inquire into the concerns<br />\nof students, faculty and administrators, the Committee was also<br />\ncharged with studying the structure of the Spring Fair Board, its<br />\nrelation to the Council, and<br />\nSAC, and the Student Services<br />\nOffice; the Council also directed<br />\nthe Committee to investigate the<br />\nsize of the Fair and the degree<br />\nof security provided.<br />\nClearly, these matters are of<br />\nconsiderable importance to the<br />\nundergraduate community; one<br />\nmight accordingly expect the<br />\nNews-Letter to cover an issue of<br />\nsuch widespread interest. However, despite Student Council's<br />\nefforts to keep the N-L apprised<br />\nof its activities \u2014 Council<br />\nSecretary Lori Malloy supplied<br />\nthe N-L with a copy of the<br />\nCouncil's charge to the Committee \u2014 the N-L chose not to cover<br />\nthe Committee's work. When<br />\nthe N-L finally decided to cover<br />\nthe Coi-nmittee's efforts, the<br />\nreporter assigned did not even<br />\nattend a single Committee meeting.<br />\nAs 'to the specifics of the<br />\narticle, the N-L's reporting was a<br />\nwealth of misinformation. In the<br />\nfirst place, the Committee has<br />\nbeen meeting not once, but<br />\n*twice, per week. At one of our<br />\nmany meetings, Major Larkin,<br />\nchief of Campus Security, testified on the nature of security<br />\nduring the Fair. Among the<br />\ntopics discussed were the following possibilities: the re-keying of<br />\nlocks, the hiring of a student<br />\nobservatory force, the restriction<br />\nof live music to the lower quad,<br />\nAt other meetings, we<br />\netc.<br />\nheard from Chris Colombo and<br />\nMary Ellen Porter of the Office<br />\nof Student Services and from<br />\nChris Quinn, John Snyder, et.<br />\nal. of last year's Spring Fair<br />\nBoard. In addition, our subcommittee on the relations between<br />\nthe Spring Fair Board and SAC<br />\ngroups solicited grievances and<br />\nsuggestions from student groups.<br />\nConfidentiality was guaranteed<br />\nto all respondents, and, contrary<br />\nto the implications of your<br />\narticle, all requests for confidentiality were respected.<br />\nBecause the Committee's<br />\nwork is of a sensitive nature,<br />\naccurate reporting, with particular attention to detail, is especially important. We sincerely<br />\nhope that the Committee's report, when published, will receive more careful coverage.<br />\nAd Hoc Committee<br />\non the Spring Fair<br />\nChris Hampton,Chairman<br /><br />\nKeep Searching Walt<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nWalter Hook, I'm glad you<br />\nare searching for the real meaning of feminism and don't want<br />\nto accept any old variety. The<br />\nproblem is:<br />\nyou have not<br /><br />\ninvented a new feminism; you<br />\nare only parroting what many<br />\nfeminists have been saying for<br />\nyears. Feminists do deal with<br />\nthe issues you address and you<br />\ntheir<br />\ngrossly<br />\nunderestimate<br />\nwork.<br />\nA difficulty with the women's liberation movement is<br />\nthat it encompasses a huge and<br />\nvery diverse group: women. It<br />\nis hard to find issues so universal<br />\nthat they attract support wide<br />\nenough to institute change. The<br />\nmore specific the movement<br />\nbecomes the narrower the support base becomes. There is<br />\ncompromise involved. I do not<br />\nadvocate compromising ideals,<br />\nbut it is unrealistic to talk about<br /><br />\nexists now. Sure, the turbulence<br />\nof social change creates new<br />\nproblems and stresses. But what<br />\nmakes you think that living in a<br />\nnon-biological group arrangement is going to make males any<br />\nmore responsive than living in a<br />\nnuclear family? True, it's easier<br />\nto end a relationship if divorce<br />\nisn't involved, but how does<br />\nabolishing marriage qualitatively<br />\nchange the relationships of men<br />\nand women? In your \"utopian\"<br />\nmodel of human relationships<br />\nand living arrangements, you<br />\ndon't explain who has final<br />\nresponsibility for the kids, who<br />\ngets the food processer or<br />\napartment if the couple breaks<br />\nup, or any other such property<br /><br />\nwould agree with you.<br />\nIn<br />\nRobert Coles' book about poor<br />\nwomen, he interviewed a mother<br />\nwho said she wished she could<br />\nstay home and raise her children<br />\nbut couldn't because the family<br />\nneeded her income. Most poor<br />\nand minority women have held<br />\ntwo jobs all their lives, working<br />\nfull time supporting the family,<br />\neither as the sole wage earner or<br />\nco-wage earner, and doing all the<br />\nhousework. In recognition of<br />\nthis major oversight the feminist<br />\nmovement is traying to promote<br />\nthe dignity and value of .all<br />\nlabor, whether it is inside or<br />\noutside the home.<br />\nAs an industrialized, core<br />\npower with a comparatively<br /><br />\nin October 16's edition of the<br />\nNews-Letter, I am appalled to<br />\nfind, once more, that the reporting is somewhat lacking. First of<br />\nall, the proposal to extend the<br />\nadvising period from three to<br />\nfive days was not voted on at all<br />\nat the last C.U.S. meeting.<br />\nThe proposal was presented and,<br />\nfollowing an absence of objections, was accepted. This may<br />\nseem a minor point, but the<br />\nmisquote of or by your source<br />\nwas very embarrassing to students present at the C.U.5.<br />\nmeeting. The secretary of the<br />\nC.U.S. noticed the discrepancy<br />\nbetween her own notes and the<br />\nNews-Letter's information and<br />\nimmediately contacted the students on C.U.S. to determine<br />\nwhere the problem lay.<br />\nSecondly, the article says<br />\nthat \"Laurie Malloy\" proposed<br />\nat the Education Committee<br />\nmeeting to have the University<br />\n\"simply pay teachers to do the<br />\nwork of TA's.\" I am Lori<br />\nMalloy, and I said nothing of the<br />\nkind. It is, first of all, a foolish<br />\nidea, and anyone suggesting this<br />\nseriously, especially to Dean<br />\nHooker, would look ridiculous.<br />\nI am embarrassed that this was<br />\nprinted and circulated to 6,000<br />\npeople<br />\n_ _ \u2022 I was not even asked tc<br />\nproofread the statement that I<br />\nsupposedly made, and I believe<br />\nthat this makes for poor reporting.<br />\nPerhaps the News-Letter<br />\nought to assign more experienced reporters to handle news<br />\nsuch as C.U.S. meetings and the<br />\nlike.<br />\nLori Malloy<br />\nEducation Committee Member<br /><br />\nchanging the whole social and<br />\neconomic structure of society if<br />\nwe can't even unite to pass the<br />\nERA. It seems that passing the<br />\nERA, if nothing more, is a<br />\nbeginning.<br />\nI disagree with many of<br />\nyour arguments. The women's<br />\nmovement is not dealing solely<br />\nwith female independence. In<br />\nthe early years of the feminist<br />\nmovement, many women were<br />\nstriving to become what being<br />\nmale stood for. Men symbolized<br />\nfreedom, capability, independence, and privilege. But, as.<br />\nwomen gained more opportunities to imitate men, they realized<br />\nthat manhood was not what<br />\nthey were really after. Today,<br />\nthe feminist movement is a<br />\nhuman liberation movement.<br />\nThe goal is to take the best<br />\ncharacteristics of traditional<br />\nmale and female roles and to<br />\nsynthesize them. We don't want<br />\na world of all men; we want to<br />\nworld of individuals.<br />\nYet, women must learn to<br />\nbe self-sufficient so they can<br />\nprotect themselves from becoming victims.<br />\nA dependent<br />\nwoman is more vulnerable to<br />\nmisuse of power, physical and<br />\nmental abuse for example, because she does not have the<br />\neconomic and social resources to<br />\nget up and walk out. Men have<br />\nalways been socialized to be<br />\nself-sufficient and women should<br />\nbe too. But independence does<br />\nnot diminish the need of men<br />\nand women for interdependence.<br />\nI don't understand how<br />\nyour proposed living alternatives<br />\nare really different -from what<br /><br />\nrelationship. Some chaos might<br />\nresult from dissolving the \"capitalist\" property rights we are<br />\naccustomed to, if we don't<br />\nreplace them with new, enlightened rights.<br />\nA problem with your stand<br />\nis that it does no<br />\n.t account for<br />\nthe differences in socialization<br />\nof males and females. Women,<br />\nas a group, have become more<br />\nenlightened about their roles in<br />\nthe last few decades and have<br />\ntaken advantage of many new<br />\nopportunities. They are undergoing drastic changes. This has<br />\nradically altered what it means<br />\nto be a woman. Unfortunately,<br />\nthe role of men has stayed far<br />\nmore rigid. This has created<br />\nstress in male-female relationships regardless of what form<br />\nthey take. That is why changing<br />\ninstitutions is not enough. We<br />\nalso have to change the attitudes<br />\nof the people who comprise the<br />\ninstitutions. We have to work<br />\nfor human liberation, to release<br />\npeople from roles that prevent<br />\nthem from realizing their human<br />\npotential.<br />\nYour use of \"bourgeois\"<br />\npuzzles me. You meant it as a<br />\nderogatory stab at the mainstream women's movement.<br />\nYou imply that the nuclear<br />\nfamily is a capitalist institution<br />\nand Eli Zaretsky would agree<br />\nBut, to use your terminology,<br />\nboth bourgeois and proletariat<br />\nwomen alike suffer from the<br />\ninequities of the traditional<br />\nfamily structure. If instead, you<br />\ntermed the movement's preoccupation with work outside<br />\nthe home bourgeois feminism, I<br /><br />\nhuge middle class, the United<br />\nStates is inherently \"bourgeois.\"<br />\nOur major labor, feminist, and<br />\ncivil rights movements have<br />\naddressed their particular issues<br />\nwithin the U.S. system. They<br />\ndon't usually advocate revolution as a solution, so they are<br />\npragmatic and, according to<br />\nsome views, do maintain the<br />\n\"bourgeois\" status quo. But I<br />\ndon't see how your article<br />\naddresses this issue, if this is the<br />\npoint you meant to make.<br />\nIn closing, I want to make it<br />\nclear that I do not blame men<br />\nfor the inequities that exist;<br />\nit is part of the society both<br />\nwomen and men have inherited.<br />\nBut I do believe we must make<br />\nthe effort to eliminate inequality.

The ERA is an \"enabling act,\" as Con-gresswoman Pat Schroeder (D-Colorado) once described<br />\nit. At best the ERA will make it harder to discriminate<br />\nagainst women. Actually to realize the equality it<br />\npromises will require additional action of many sorts.<br />\nThere is vocal opposition to the ERA from some<br />\nquarters, most notably several groups organized under<br />\nthe umbrella of STOP ERA, headed by Phyllis Schlafly.<br />\nAnd many feminists were outraged when the Republican<br />\nParty withdrew its support for the ERA from its 1980<br />\ncampaign platform.<br />\nIt is important, however, when considering the<br />\nERA and its opposition to place it in the larger context<br />\nof anti-feminist activity in America.

Senator Paul Laxalt (R-Nevada), for<br />\nexample, has recently introduced a new version of the<br />\nFamily Protection Act (FPA). The 38 provisions of the<br />\nFPA can be introduced in clumps, separately, or as riders<br />\nto other bills.<br />\nSome of the most significant provisions would<br />\nachieve the following: to cut funds for child care and<br />\nold age care, to ban federal funds for the protection of<br />\nbattered women and abused children, to prohibit funds<br />\nto schools using materials that \"tend to denigrate,<br />\ndiminish, or deny the role difference between the sexes<br />\nas it has been historically understood in the U.S.\" In<br />\naddition, the FPA would prohibit funds to schools \"not<br />\nallowing voluntary prayer,\" deny basic civil rights to<br />\nlesbians and gay men, deny federal funds to school<br />\ndistricts requiring union membership for their employees, and prohibit funds for contraception, counseling, and abortion services.<br />\nMany people insist the FPA is too broad and<br />\nconservative to become law. Whether or not they<br />\nare correct, the FPA is important to take seriously<br />\nbecause sections of the bill are already becoming law.<br />\nFurthermore, examination of the Act provided significant insights concerning the general attacks on women's<br />\nrights.

It bans the federal<br />\nemployee health insurance program from paying for<br />\nabortions except in life-threatening situations. The<br />\ninsurance plan covers nearly 10 million government<br />\nworkers, spouses, and their children. Last year it paid<br />\nfor 17,000 abortions.<br />\nSimilarly, the hearings on funding for the Legal<br />\nServices Corporation included a rider taken almost<br />\nverbatim from the Family Protection Act: the Legal<br />\nServices Corporation will be barred from any litigation<br />\ninvolving abortion, school desegregation, divorce or gay<br />\nrights. Attacks on gay and lesbian rights are not gratuitous, by the way, since they threaten the traditional<br />\nstereotypes of personal relationships and family structure.<br /><br />\nFPA: Leadership<br />\nSeveral characteristics of the FPA demonstrate<br />\nits broader implications. First, its sponsor's qualifications are similar to those of many pro-lifers. They do<br />\nnot merely act out of religious or moral principles;<br />\nrather, they are active on other conservative issues<br />\nand/or organizations. This is a point that feminists<br />\nBarbara Ehrenreich and Barbara Winslow both made at<br />\nlast year's GRO Spring Symposium,\"Feminism and the<br />\nCritique of Capitalism:\"<br />\nFor example, Phyllis Schlafly, leader of STOP<br />\nERA, is one the Board of Directors of the American<br />\nConservative Union and the Eagle Forum, both of which<br />\nare multi-issue conservative groups.

Ronald Reagan's budget cuts nicely<br />\ncomplement \"pro-family\" legislation by making it hard<br />\nfor women to work outside the home. As British<br />\nfeminist Joan Smith points out, women lose in two<br />\nways. First, budget cuts reduce the number and quality<br />\nof government services available to working women such<br />\nas day care and school lunch programs. Second, many<br /><br />\nThe FPA's provision to deny federal funds to<br />\nschool districts requiring union membership for their<br />\nemployees further underscores conservative opposition<br />\nto women's economic self-determination. Unions can<br />\nprovide working women with a way to organize against<br />\nunsafe working conditions and low wages.<br /><br />\nSterilization Abuse<br />\nWomen are also subject to enforced sterilizations,<br />\nof sterilization abuse. This occurs in numerous ways but<br />\nthe most important is probably sterilization through<br />\nunsafe working conditions. One source estimates that<br />\napproximately two million women work in situations<br />\ndangerous to pregnancy and fetal development. These<br />\nusually involve handling suspect chemicals. Thus working women have resorted to union membership as a<br />\nprotection against working conditions that threaten<br />\nsterilization.<br /><br />\nmethod for the drug which \"can be offered by paramedical personnel in large-scale sterilization programs.\"<br />\nAnother AID-assisted sterilization program was<br />\nundertaken in Puerto Rico. As Linda Gordon reported<br />\nin Woman's Body, Woman's Right, 35 percent of Puerto<br />\nRican women of childbearing age are sterilized. Further,<br />\ntwo-thirds of them are still in their twenties.<br />\nFeminist activists argue that sterilization abuse is<br />\nlinked to population control and that these practices<br />\nmust be clearly distinguished from birth control. Population control is defined as imposing limits on another<br />\ngroup's fertility and reproduction for the benefit of the<br />\nfirst group. Hence, American feminists insist, they must<br />\nextend their demands to control their own reproductive<br />\nlives to include other women at home and abroad. This<br />\nis especially true for men and women who work in<br />\nlaboratories or health care occupations. They have a<br />\nright to know what chemicals they work with and a<br />\nresponsibility to protect the reproductive rights of<br />\nothers.<br /><br />\nBut protections for women workers can also be<br />\nturned against them, however, as a recent case at E.I.<br />\nDuPont Nemours illustrates. The New York Times<br />\nrecently reported that the corporate medical director of<br />\nDuPont appeared before a Congressional subcommittee<br />\nand testified that DuPont exercises special controls<br />\nregarding women workers. They remove women who<br />\nare \"assumed to be fertile\" from workplaces if they<br />\nbelieve that a particular chemical might damage a fetus.<br />\nThus, in the name of safety, many women are barred<br />\nfrom better-paying positions. Those who aren't risk<br />\nsterility. On the job this \"choice\" is called the \"double<br />\nbind.\"<br />\nNonetheless, women are better off wit/z this<br />\nprotection than without it \u2014 much like the ERA. Thus<br />\nworkers have fought vigorously to save OSHA guidelines.<br />\nprotecting their right-to-know what dangerous materials<br />\nor chemicals they may be working with. President<br />\nReagan's Labor Secretary Ray Donovan has killed most of<br />\nthe OSHA regulations. This may force workers to work<br />\nwith dangerous chemicals, and it can force women to<br />\ntake different, perhaps less well-paid positions in work<br />\nareas deemed safe for them. Some women will continue<br />\nto be given the choice of having themselves sterilized or<br />\nface losing their jobs.<br /><br />\n\"In one Native American<br />\ntribe in Oklahoma, the<br />\nrate of sterilization of fertile women is over 80<br />\npercent - enough to guar entee that the tribe will<br />\nnot be able to exist past<br />\nanother generation.\"<br /><br />\nwomen are employed in service sector jobs funded by<br />\nthe government.

Anna<br />\n(Meryl Streep) mimes an attempt to free<br />\nthe hem of her skirt from a bramble bush,<br />\nwhile in another corner of the room,<br />\nMike (Jeremy Irons) stands waiting.<br />\nAnna looks up suddenly at Mike, her face<br />\nregistering surprise. She starts toward<br />\nhim, stumbles and falls \u2014 and lands, in<br />\nfull costume, on the soft grass of the<br />\nUndercliff at Lyme Regis, as Sarah<br />\nWoodruff, woman of mystery circa 1867,<br />\nand heroine of John Fowles' novel The<br />\nMike,<br />\nFrench Lieutenant's Woman.<br />\nmeanwhile, has likewise metamorphosed<br />\ninto Charles Smithson, Victorian gentleman and paleontologist, and rushes to<br />\nSarah's aid.<br />\nIn the novel, Fowles relates the<br />\nstory of Charles and Sarah's windswept<br />\nromance using the voice of an unquestionably 20th-century narrator, who<br />\nconstantly interrupts the 19th-century<br />\nproceedings with commentary which<br />\nhelps put the story in historical perspective, thereby making the contrasts and<br />\nparallels between the ages as much as part<br />\nof his book as the plot. It is the particular<br />\naccomplishment of screenwriter Harold<br />\nPinter and director Karel Reisz that, in<br />\nbringing The French Lieutenant's Woman<br />\nto the screen, they have captured the<br />\nspirit of Fowles' work by employing a<br />\ncinematic device which achieves,if not an<br />\nidentical, at least a similar, narrative<br />\neffect: the juxtaposition of the Victorian<br />\ntale with the present-day story of an<br />\naffair between the actor and actress who<br />\nare playing Charles and Sarah in a film.<br /><br />\nThe period piece is the account of<br />\nCharles' growing infatuation with Sarah, a<br />\nwoman beyond her time, the allure of<br />\nwhose tainted past \u2014 rumor has it that<br />\nshe once had an illicit relationship with a<br />\nyoung French lieutenant \u2014 gradually<br />\nleads him to actions which threaten<br />\nto ruin both his status as gentleman and<br />\nhis prospects for marriage to Ernestina<br />\nFreeman (Lynsey Baxter), the prim<br />\ndaughter Qf a wealthy London businessman. While visiting Ernestina at her<br />\naunt's home in Lyme Regis, a small<br />\nseaport village in the south of England,<br />\nCharles first glimpses Sarah on the Cobb,<br />\na talon-like stone pier which bends<br />\noutward into the English Channel. Sarah<br />\noften stands at the far end of the Cobb,<br />\nstaring across the water \u2014 awaiting, the<br />\ntownspeople say, the return of her<br />\nFrench lieutenant. From the moment<br />\nwhen the startled women tears her gaze<br /><br />\nI/\\IR 1 51<br />\nfrom the sea and toward Charles, his<br />\ncuriosity is engaged. And by the time he<br />\nmeets her a second time, while hunting<br />\nfossils on the Undercliff a few days later,<br />\nCharles' fascination with Sarah has<br />\nalready taken on the characteristics<br />\nof an obsession.<br />\nMike, the modern actor, behaves<br />\nat times with typical 20th-century<br />\nmachismo, yet shares this romantic<br />\nsensibility with his Victorian counterpart;<br />\nlikewise Anna, who with her combination<br />\nof flightiness and no-nonsense professionalism possesses nowhere near the melo-<br /><br />\nMeryl Streep as Sarah in a pensive moment on the Undercliff<br /><br />\nNot Just A Bookstore, It's An Adventure<br />\nBY JOE LEVINE<br />\n\"Actually, the place used to be a<br />\nbeauty parlor,\" said manager Warren<br />\nWigatow, indicating the cavernous interior of the Second Story Book Store with<br />\na single sweep of his hand. \"But things<br />\nwere a little different then. There were a<br />\nlot more sinks.\"<br />\nSinks are perhaps the only weird<br />\nbit of paraphernalia not\u2022in evidence at the<br />\nnewly opened Second Story, located at<br />\n527 North Charles Street, one block<br />\nsouth of the Peabody Conservatory.<br />\nEverything from hand-crafted masks to<br />\nmulti-media art displays in enclosed<br />\nbooths are included in this truly unique<br />\nenterprise. But lest the passing bibliophile write off Second Story as another<br />\ntrendy spin-off of the slick best-seller<br />\nsupermarkets, rest assured: they have<br />\nbooks. Wigatow estimates the store's<br /><br />\nSecond Story Books just moments<br />\nbefore another rush of bibliophiles<br /><br />\nstock at \"40,000 and climbing,\" and not<br />\nall of these are different-colored editions<br />\nof The World According To Carp.<br />\n\"We're similar to places like the<br />\nGotham in New York,\" Wigatow says,<br />\n\"but with a difference. We're not only for<br />\nthe serious literati.\" He points to a large<br />\nselection of cook books on one wall.<br />\nSerious literati should find their<br />\nneeds amply taken care of, however. In<br />\naddition to a wide range of contemporary<br />\nfiction (one can find works by such<br />\nwriters as Grace Paley, Alice Adams,<br />\nand Hopkins' own Steve Dixon), there is<br />\nan extensive collection titled \"Fine and<br />\nRare Books,\" which contains first editions of Melville, Dickens, and Poe. The<br />\nstore also has what may be the largest<br />\nassortment of small-press poetry in the<br />\ncity.<br />\nFor those of slightly lower brow,<br />\nthere are not only cookbooks, but art<br />\nbooks, how-to paperbacks, and those neat<br />\nlittle flip books which look like old<br />\nmovies when you thumb the pages real<br />\nfast. There i also a large selection of<br />\nscholarly works, and a big .shelf of used<br />\nclassical and jazz records.<br />\nWhile taking in the many aspects<br />\nof Second Story, one gets the idea that<br />\nthis was somebody's brainchild. The<br />\nproud parents are Kirby Malone, arts<br />\ndirector for the store, and owner Allan<br />\nStypek.<br />\n\"We're trying to be a major<br />\ncontemporary arts center,\" he said. \"We<br />\nwant this to be the kind of place that<br />\npeople coming from Europe and the West<br />\nCoast know about and plan to visit.\"<br />\nIt's too early to assess quality, but<br />\nif variety and novelty alone are sufficient<br />\nindication, Malone may not be pipedreaming. Second Story has a video and<br />\nfilm theater, a musical performance stage,<br />\nand space for fiction and poetry readings<br />\n(William Burroughs will be reading there<br />\nin November).<br />\nMalone himself will<br />\nparticipate next Wednesday in an ongoing<br /><br />\ndramatic solemnity of Sarah, still has in<br />\ncommon with her character a muted yet<br />\nvigorous sensuality. While Mike and<br />\nAnna's relationship is not detailed with<br />\nnearly as much care as Charles and<br />\nSarah's (all told, it takes up only about a<br />\nquarter of the film's running time), the<br />\nsimilarities between the two stories create<br />\na surprising amount of dramatic friction,<br />\nand raise more than a few questions<br />\nabout the nature of love and romance as<br />\nmanifested in our own age as well as in<br />\nthe 19th century.<br />\nThis, more than<br />\nanything else, is the greatest strength of<br />\nThe French Lieutenant's Woman.<br />\nIt is by no means the film's only<br />\nstrength. Director Reisz and cinematographer Freddie Francis have given<br />\ntheir movie, especially in the Victorian<br />\nsequences, a striking visual beauty:<br />\nbrilliant green countrysides and slate-grey \u2022<br />\nseascapes, slick moonlit cobblestone<br />\nstreets and sitting-rooms filled with<br />\ntapestries, brass, and varnished wood.<br />\nThe music, by Carl Davis, is richly evocative, always staying just this side of<br />\nschmaltz. Pinter's screenplay remains<br />\nclear and concise even as it jumps back<br />\nand forth between the centuries. The<br />\nsupporting actors \u2014 particularly Leo<br />\nMcKern, as a Lyme physician; Hilton<br />\nMcRae, as Sam, Charles' manservant;<br />\nPatience Collier, as Mrs. Poulteney,<br />\nSarah's employer; David Warner, as a<br />\nmagistrate; and Penelope Wilton, as the<br />\nwife of Mike, the actor \u2014 provide finely<br />\ntuned portraits of minor characters<br />\nwhich, in the hands of less skilled performers, might otherwise have come off<br />\nas simple stereotypes.<br />\nMeryl Streep acquits herself well<br />\nin the difficult dual roles of Sarah and<br />\nAnna, but it is Jeremy limns' impassioned<br />\nrenderings of Charles and Mike which<br />\nultimately give the film its power, most<br />\nnotably in its final scenes. Irons captures<br />\nadmirably in Charles the dilemma of a<br />\nman forced by the dictates of society to<br />\nbury his sexuality under a heap of carefully cultivated gentlemanly attributes,<br />\nand as Mike he sketches the almost<br />\nimperceptible suffering of a man not<br />\nquite sure how to balance his longings<br />\nagainst the ever-shifting loyalties of the<br />\nelusive Modern Woman. Irons' sensitive<br />\nperformance ties the narrative threads of<br />\nThe French Lieutenant's Woman together, and reminds us that the pursuit of<br />\nlove was never any less difficult in ages<br />\npast than it is today.<br /><br />\nmulti-media performance series at the<br />\nstore.<br />\nThe arts center grew out of<br />\nMalone's work with two Baltimore arts<br />\nand performance groups, BaltiMedia and<br />\nDesire Productions. These groups, which<br />\nare clogely related, have been responsible<br />\nfor first-time airings of the works of<br />\nmany local artists. They have produced<br />\nmulti-media shows at School 33, the<br />\nCharles Theatre, and the Glass Pavilion<br />\nhere at Hopkins. It was, in fact, a group<br />\nof some 20 artists from the two groups<br />\nwho did the actual renovation work on<br />\nthe interior of Second Story Books.<br />\n\"This all came about as a result of<br />\nmy asking for a part-time job here originally,\" Malone said. \"I got to know Allan,<br />\nand one night I said, just joking really,<br />\n'Wouldn't it be great to turn this into a<br />\nmulti-arts center?' Well, he really liked<br />\nthe idea and here we are.\"<br />\nStypek, who owns anothei- Second Story on Greenmount and four other<br />\nstores in Washington, D.C., is venturing .The French Lieutenant's Woman is curinto new conceptual territory with- this rently showing at the Towson Theater,<br />\nstore.

Last week it was<br />\npenalties. No one can say that<br />\nJohns Hopkins is playing perfect<br />\nfootball, but the last two weeks<br />\nhave produced two victories<br />\nthat allow the Blue Jays to take<br />\na -winning record (3-2) up to<br />\nLebanon Valley tomorrow.<br />\nFor both teams in tomorrow's contest, 1981 has been a<br />\nstep upward. The Flying Dutchmen, winless in 1980, have<br />\nbeaten Swarthmore and Ursinus.<br />\nAs for the Jays, they avenged a<br />\n1980 loss for the second consecutive week. With the defense<br />\nand special teams again producing opportunities and the offense coming back from the<br />\ndead, the Jays put away Ursinus<br />\n21-7.<br />\nIt may well have been the<br />\nJays' best game of the season.<br />\nThe Jay defense put on its<br />\nfourth strong performance of<br />\nthe year and has now allowed<br />\nonly 12 points per game. The<br />\nJays picked up 23 first downs to<br />\nnine for the Grizzly Bears. Not<br />\nonly did Hopkins outgain<br />\nUrsinus 349-164 in total offense,<br />\nbut half of the entire Bear<br />\nproduction<br />\nwas<br />\noffensive<br />\nchurned out in a single pass. So<br />\ndominant was the Hopkins defense that the Bears did not<br />\nmanage a first down until the<br /><br />\n7:13 mark of the second quarter<br />\nand did not get inside the<br />\nHopkins 30 until six minutes<br />\nremained in the game.<br />\nBut it almost turned out to<br />\nbe a tale of missed opportunities, as was the case at Swarth-<br /><br />\nscore. \"Whether it was a confidence factor or what, I can't<br />\nput my finger on it, but I was<br />\nhappy with the improvement,\"<br />\nsaid coach Jerry Pfeifer.

After a twoame hiatus, Stromber a ain<br /><br />\nJack Flynn averaged 38.2<br />\nyards on five punts to give a<br />\nboost to his average, and the<br />\nJays again did much to diminish<br />\ntheir opponent's average by<br />\nblocking their second punt in<br />\nthree games, which more importantly set up the Jays' first<br />\nscore. A host of Jay rushers<br />\noverwhelmed Bear punter Alan<br />\nChester early in the third period<br />\nand smothered the kick; Jamie<br />\nEdwards picked up the loose ball<br />\nat the Bear 30 and ran it down<br />\nto the six.<br />\nLeast encouraging proved to<br />\nbe the quarterback protection,<br />\nwhich had been exceptional<br />\nup to that point. The Ursinus<br />\ndefensive line, led by Jim Kelly<br />\nand Mark Schmidt, nailed Jim<br />\nMargraff behind the line of<br />\nscrimmage ten times. The Jays<br />\ntwice penetrated the Bear 20 in<br />\nthe first half. The first drive,<br />\ncoming on a 28-yard pass to<br />\nStromberg, was halted by a sack.<br />\nzr. The second, in which the Jays<br />\ngot to the Ursinus 14 in the final<br />\nminute of the half, was snuffed<br />\nout when Kelly smothered<br />\nMargraff from behind for a<br />\nten-yard loss.<br /><br />\nMargraff scrambles out of the pocket<br />\nmore.

It's not easy to conceal a<br />\nshotgun or dart gun in a crowd<br />\nof 20,000, sighting the sights<br />\nalthough they should've been<br />\nsighted before the impending<br />\nassassinatiort, revealing the guns<br />\nso that.no one else knows that<br />\na gun will be fired shortly, taking<br />\naim and then firing as if he were<br />\njust eating a hotdog and sipping<br />\na beer without spilling any on<br />\nthe child sitting next to him,<br />\nthereby not arousing his suspi-<br /><br />\ncion, for he doesn't want anyone<br />\nto know that he is responsible<br />\nfor the dead guy on the field \u2014<br />\nthat's only if he manages to get a<br />\nround off before the guy in<br />\nfront of him stands up and<br />\napplauds a 8-3-8 triple play with<br />\nthe shortstop playing out on the<br />\noutfield grass with one out.<br />\nBaseball assassinations are<br />\neasy unless the targeted 'player<br />\nruns a 4.4 forty and plays<br />\ncenterfield although the opportune moment to assassinate is<br />\nwhen a ball has a hang time of<br />\nmore than ten seconds and floats<br />\nthrough the air with a guy on<br />\nthird waiting to score when<br />\nthe guy in center, although he<br />\ncan be in right, catches the ball<br />\nunless the assassin has fired his<br />\nweapon prematurely; it's the<br />\nbest time because every one is<br />\neither watching the guy on third<br />\nor the guy in center waiting for<br />\nthe ball that he must release and<br />\nthrow immediatly if he wants to<br />\nwin the game, for the winning<br />\nrun is on third and the assassin<br />\nknows this and has bet heavily<br />\non the game with his bookie<br />\nwho happens to be his employer.<br />\nAs I was saying, baseball<br />\nassassinations are difficult compared with golf assassinations<br />\nbecause golfers are stupid and<br />\nare easy prey for the sporting<br />\nassassin, who stands in the<br />\ngalley or behind one of the trees<br />\nin the forest waiting for his<br />\nfavorite golfer to slice or hook;<br />\nit all depends on what side of<br />\nthe fairway the tree is located<br />\non, because the assassin doesn't<br />\nwant to kill any caddies who are<br />\nunemployed Monday, Tuesday,<br />\nand Wednesday while the golfers<br />\ntravel and clean their clubs on<br />\ntheir off days, so it's important<br />\nthat the assassin be positioned<br /><br />\nperfectly for the kill because he<br />\nhates golf and likes blue-collar<br />\nworkers.<br />\nBut sports assassins aren't<br />\nthat bad; they're athletes in the<br />\ntruest sense because they hunt<br />\nfellow athletes who are boring to<br />\nwatch while the assassin's exploits are exciting and different<br />\nto witness when and if assassinations do occur, for it costs more<br />\nto attend a sporting event<br />\nthan to attend a political rally<br />\nwhere they don't mind shooting<br />\nnon-athletes who are only athletic when they are being covered<br />\nby the press.<br /><br />\nshowing: \"The officiating left a<br />\nlot to be desired. There were<br />\nmany bad calls that hurt both<br />\nteams. Short of murder, nothing<br />\nwould have been called. We<br />\n(both teams) would have done<br />\nbetter officiating ourselves, calling our own fouls.\" What more<br />\ncould be said to describe the<br />\naction in a scoreless game?<br />\n\"Well, it was a beautiful<br />\nday,\" said Oliver.<br />\nYes, the Blue Says do have<br />\nan offense. The leaders in goals<br />\nthis year are Gary Rice with<br />\nfour, and Triffin Psyhojos and<br />\nMike Biggs with two apiece.<br />\nRice and Dan Olszewski lead in<br />\nthe assist category, each having<br />\ntwo.<br />\nThis Saturday the soccer<br />\nteam will play on the new field<br />\nfor the first time against Franklin and Marshall College, who<br />\nwill enter the game with a 9-2-1<br />\nrecord overall. \"They are a very<br />\ngood team,\" said Oliver. Indeed<br />\nthey are, for they walloped<br />\nSwarthmore earlier this year,<br />\n6-0.<br /><br />\nNeedless to say, head coach<br />\nBob Oliver was displeased by<br />\nHopkins' lack of offense, but<br />\nhad nothing but praise for<br />\ngoalie Neil Watnik, who is \"the<br />\nbest goalkeeper in the southeastern section,\" according to<br />\nOliver, and the statistics prove<br />\nhim right. Watnick has allowed<br />\nslightly more than one goal per<br />\ngame, and he and backs Bob<br />\nRamage, David Plaut, and Dan<br />\nOlszewski have put Hopkins in a<br />\ntie (!) for the fourth best defense in the MAC, which conOliver said, \"How do you<br />\ntains 25 teams. \"Neil played<br />\nextraordinarily well. He had a spell frustration? T-I-E-(S). If<br />\nlot of good saves,\" said Ortega. they were wins, we'd be assured<br />\nThe Blue Jays offense \"didn't of first place.\" But don't worry.<br />\nplay to our potential,\" he added. The Jays aren't eliminated from<br />\nOliver seemed more out- post-season play yet.<br />\nThey might end up in a tie<br />\nraged with the officials than<br />\nwith his team's poor offensive with Swarthmore for first place.<br /><br />\n\"Southern Comfort Could Be The<br />\nMost Daring Movie Of The Fall<br />\nSeason --And The Most Riviting!\"<br />\n-Michael Sragow, ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE<br /><br />\nTHE WEEK IN SPORTS<br />\nFriday, Oct. 23<br />\nField Hockey vs. Haverford<br />\n3.30 p.m.(A)<br />\nSaturday, Oct. 24<br />\nFootball vs. Lebanon Valley<br />\n1 .30 p.m.(A)<br />\nWomen's Cross Country vs. Navy<br />\n1 .00 p.m.(A)<br />\nMen's Cross Country vs. Haverford at<br />\nWashington Cal.. . 2:00 p.m.(A)<br />\nSoccer vs. Franklin &amp; Marshall,<br />\n2-00 p.m.(11)<br />\nTuesday,Oct. 2,<br />\nWomen's Cross Country vs. York<br />\n4.00 p.m.(H)<br />\nField Hochey vs. Dickinson<br />\n3-00 p.m.(H)<br />\nWednesday,Oct. 28<br />\nMen's Cross Country vs. Loyola<br />\n4100 p.m.(A)<br />\nSoccer vs. Widener<br />\n3-00 p.m.(H)<br />\nThursday, Oct. 29<br />\nField Hockey vs. Georgetown<br />\n3.30 p.m.(A)<br /><br />\nIt's the land of hospitality.., unless you don't belong there.<br /><br />\nSOUTHERN ComFokr<br />\nKeith Carradine Powers Boothe Fred Ward T.K.
