Following the recommendation made by the Council<br />\nlast year, a ledger was purchased<br />\nin the fall, in which the managers<br />\nof all the organizations were required to enter their detailed accounts.

All accounts are audited by an officer of<br />\nthe university.<br />\nDuring the year 576 student<br />\ntickets were issued, giving a total<br />\nrevenue of $5,760.00. From other<br />\nsources the activities have acquired<br />\n$8,178.57. To date there are accounts outstanding, aggregating to<br />\napproximately $4,000.00, nearly all<br />\nowed by advertisers.
