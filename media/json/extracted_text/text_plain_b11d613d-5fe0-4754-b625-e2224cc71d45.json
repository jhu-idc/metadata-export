We are fighting now for a<br />\nclean-cut American victory\u2014a victory that, translated into peace<br />\nterms, will mean a distinct and<br />\npermanent gain for America and<br />\nAmericanism.

He had published<br />\nthree slender volumes of verse,<br />\nhad rejected opportunitiesfor a military career, and, being now hopelessly estranged from Mr. Allen,<br />\nhad tried in vain to find congenial<br />\nemployment.

It is<br />\nthe principle and example to others<br />\nwhich is the main factor, and the<br />\naction taken will without doubt<br />\nstand as a fitting exaMple to the<br />\nentire community. \u2014 From The<br />\nBrown and White, Lehigh.<br />\n* \u2022 *<br />\nIn a campaign of less than 48<br />\nhours' duration $924.66 was raised<br />\nby students at Vassar for the relief of refugees at Halifax.<br />\n* * *<br />\nThe Omicron Delta Kappa, of<br />\nthe University of Pittsburgh, has<br />\n15 men in the service.<br />\n* \u2022 *<br />\nStudents and alumni of the University of Pittsburgh have raised<br />\nan endowment fund of $500,000<br />\nfor the university.<br />\n\u25aa * *<br />\nThe Indiana Daily Student<br />\nfinds that seven of the last nine<br />\nPresidents of the United States<br />\nhave been Phi Beta Kappa men.<br />\n* * *<br />\nPennsylvania State College's<br />\nlatest decoration is a huge service flag, carrying more than five<br />\nhundred stars, made by the hand<br />\nwork of co-eds and of wives of the<br />\ncollege instructors.

Although the score appears one-sided, the game was<br />\ninteresting and hotly contested,<br />\nespecialy during the first half.<br />\nHopkins started off with a<br />\nrush; they kept the Annapolis lads<br />\nfrom scoring for about five minutes by their excellent defense<br />\nwork, but they themselves were<br />\nunable to gather any points. Then<br />\nWelch, of the Navy five, caged a<br />\nfoul goal, and a few minutes later<br />\nCaptain Allen, of the Navy,scored<br />\none from the field.<br />\nBut the home team was not destined to hold this lead very long,<br />\nfor, after \"Doc\" Love had missed<br />\na foul shot, Kennedy got-the ball<br />\nand made one of the prettiest field<br />\ngoals of the game. Hopkins, at<br />\nthis period of the game, was playing the fast and heavy Navy team<br />\nto a standstill. A few minutes<br />\nlater Kennedy caged another very<br />\ndifficult basket, and the score was<br />\n4 to 3 in Hopkins favor.<br />\nHopkins maintained this lead<br />\nfor several minutes, and the hundreds of ensigns, who packed all<br />\nfour sides of the court, shouted<br />\nfor Hopkins and then begged<br />\ntheir team to get started. Very<br />\nsoon another goal was caged by<br />\nthe Navy, and they were once more<br />\nout in front, but the score was<br />\ntied a few seconds later when<br />\n\"Doc\" Love succeded in caging a<br />\nfree throw from the foul circle.<br />\nThis ended Hopkins scoring for<br />\nthe first half and for the whole<br />\ngame. The team, being in poor<br />\ncondition, could not stand the<br />\nstrain, and Navy had everything<br />\nher own way from this time on.<br />\nA long string of field goals and<br />\nfoul goals were made immediately<br />\nafter this by the Navy forwards,<br />\nand the first halt ended, 25 to 5,<br />\nin favor of the midshipmen.<br />\nThe second half was a repetition of the latter part of the first,<br />\nthe ensigns making 28 points in<br />\nthis perioad, while Hopkins could<br />\nnot even get a single foul goal.<br />\nNavy sent in their substitutes in<br />\nthe last five minutes, and a few<br />\nseconds later Hopkins followed<br />\nsuit. The Navy subs managed to<br />\nadd a few points to their total,<br />\nwhile the second string men of<br />\nthe Independents could not score<br />\nat all.

The preparation of<br />\nthe Carroll Mansion for occupancy by the Hopkins Club and<br />\nthe remodeling of the \"Barn\"\u2014so<br />\nthe Students' Building continues<br />\nto be named\u2014were in progress<br />\nwhen the University opened, and<br />\nboth buildings were available in<br />\na few weeks. The \"Barn,\" transformed so as to provide a lunchroom, a barber shop, various offices and board rooms,- and a large<br />\ncommon-room which the Y. M. C.<br />\nA. supplies with reading matter<br />\nand a piano, was put under the<br />\ncontrol of the Student Council. It<br />\nconstitutes a self-governing club<br />\nfor undergraduates, comparable in<br />\nservice and convenience to the<br />\nHopkins Club for graduate students and faculty.<br />\nAs was to be expected, the effect upon undergraduate life of removal to Homewood was marked.<br />\nThe largest freshman class yet<br />\nenrolled entered in October, 1916.<br />\nDistinctive caps\u2014black and blue<br />\nwith a yellow button\u2014ordainedby<br />\nthe Student Council for freshmen, were worn for the first<br />\ntime. The requirements of physical training were increased from<br />\none to two years1 and by the organiation of a battalion of the Officers Reserve Training Corps it<br />\nwas made possible for students to<br />\nsecurethe prescribed exercise in the<br />\nform of military training. At the<br />\nrequest of a majority Of the undergraduates, a schedule was<br />\nadopted, experimentally in the<br />\nspring, and continued in October,<br />\naccording to which classes begin<br />\nat 8.30 in the morning and laboratory exercises run from 1 to 4<br />\nP. M. The result is to afford daylight practice for the football<br />\nteam and adequate time for military drill.<br />\nThe dominant interest of all departments of the University during the second half-year was of<br />\ncourse the declaration of war.<br />\nThe trustees had already pledged<br />\ntheir support, and both faculty<br />\nand students regarded the national cause as their first duty. Members of the technical departments<br />\ngave their services at once. Numbers of upper classmen enlisted in<br />\nthe battalion and drills were increased. Various members of the<br />\ncorps received commissions in the<br />\narmy, and many more were subject to call in different units of<br />\nthe National Guard. The faculty<br />\nprovided for the immediate release<br />\nof students who wished to enter<br />\nthe service: and later extended the<br />\nsame privilege to those who were<br />\nneeded in agricultural work.<br />\n<br />\nAbout 40 per cent. of the undergraduates were thus dismissed,<br />\nand those who remained made<br />\nplans for serious employment during the summer. The lack of a<br />\nstaff from which to fly the colors<br />\nled the Layfield Committee to<br />\nchoose as a fitting memorial to<br />\nRobert Layfield two flag poles to<br />\nstand directly in front of Gilman<br />\nHall. The poles, suitably inscribed, were dedicated in the<br />\npresence of the battalion and a<br />\ncollege audience.<br />\nThe closing weeks were uneventful. Many of the usual<br />\nspring activities were given up,<br />\nnot because they could not be carried on, but because the greater issues in every one's mind made<br />\nthem seem trivial. The celebration of senior week was abandoned. At commencement an unusual number of degrees were conferred in absentia and several to<br />\ncandidates who appeared in military uniform.

ROPER,<br />\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue.<br />\n<br />\nCollege men can perform a practical patriotic service in connection with the War Tax Law. If<br />\nthe Government is to obtain the<br />\nfull amount of revenue authorized<br />\nby Congress it is essential that<br />\nevery taxpayer shall know how to<br />\ncompute the amount of taxes he<br />\nmust pay and the time, place, and<br />\nmethod provided for its payment.<br />\nThe new Income Tax Law will<br />\nreach more than seven million persons who have never before paid a<br />\nFederal income tax. Every unmarried person who had a net income in 1917 of more than s1,000<br />\nand every in<br />\nperson whose<br />\nnet income was more than $2,000<br />\nis required by law to make a return to the Collector of Internal<br />\nRevenue for his district. He must<br />\nnot wait for the collector to call<br />\non him or send him a notice. He<br />\nmust voluntarily apply to the collector for the income tax form. If<br />\ncollege men will familiarize themselves with the War Revenue Act<br />\nand point out to their parents and<br />\nothers with whom they come in<br />\ncontact what the law requires<br />\nthem to do they will be rendering<br />\na patriotic service.<br />\nThe purpose of the war tax is..<br />\nidentical with that of the Liberty<br />\nLoan. Its patriotic appeal is even<br />\nstronger, for instead of an investment it calls for a contribution.<br />\nThe bond buyer loans\u2014the taxpayer gives \u2014.to the cause of<br />\nliberty. The splendid success of<br />\nthe Liberty Loan was achieved<br />\nthrough the co-operative effort of<br />\npatriotic leaders everywhere in the<br />\ndissemination of information and<br />\nthe fostering of patriotic sentiment.<br />\nAs we press forward in this<br />\ngreat war struggle, sustained by<br />\nthe hope of a victorious peace, we<br />\n\u00bbilist bear in mind that only by<br />\nmeeting in the fullest degree our<br />\nindividual responsibilities as citizens (wit we insure ourselves<br />\nagainst the 'unthinkable COM8Cres of defeat.

The account follows:<br />\n\"The most significant event in<br />\nthe literary life of Edgar Allan<br />\nPoe was his success in what would<br />\nHOW be called a short-story contest, instituted by a Baltimore<br />\nweekly paper in the summer of<br />\n1833. At this time Poe was living<br />\nin obscurity with relatives in<br />\nBaltimore. He had published<br />\nthree slender volumes of verse,<br />\nhad rejected opportunitiesfor a military career, and, being now hopelessly estranged from Mr. Allen,<br />\nhad tried in vain to find congenial<br />\nemployment. When the Baltimore<br />\nSaturday lisiter offered a prize<br />\nof $50 for the best tale and $25 for<br />\nthe best short poem, Poe submitted manuscripts forboth prizes.<br />\nThejudges awarded him the larger<br />\nprize without hesitation, and apparently would have given him the<br />\nother prize also if they had not<br />\nthought it undesirable for one<br />\ncompetitor to receive both. One<br />\nof these judges was John P. Kennedy, already ivell known as an<br />\nauthor. He became at once Poe's<br />\nfriend and adviser, secured him<br />\nthe editorship of the Southern Literary Messenger, and rescued him<br />\nfrom the despair that might well<br />\nhave prevented him from leading<br />\na literary life.<br /><br />\nAlumni Obituary.<br /><br />\nJames Curlander, A.

Further, he advised cutting off heat<br />\nfrom rooms in which it is not<br />\nneeded; keeping doors closed; turning off heat and light when leaving the office; eliminating most of<br />\nthe heat in hallways, which comprise about 10 per cent, of office<br />\nbuilding space; providing engineers and firemen with instruments that will help them in conserving fuel; and paying firemen<br />\nbonuses for savings effected.<br />\nProfesor Christie also urged an<br />\nintensive campaign that would acquaint- everyone with workable<br />\nmethods for saving coal.<br /><br />\nBitterly disappointed for not<br />\ngetting a crack at each other on<br />\nthe gridiron and hardly satisfied<br />\nwith the uncertain results of that<br />\nmemorable rush, the underclassmen will gather in the C.

The preparation of<br />\nthe Carroll Mansion for occupancy by the Hopkins Club and<br />\nthe remodeling of the \"Barn\"\u2014so<br />\nthe Students' Building continues<br />\nto be named\u2014were in progress<br />\nwhen the University opened, and<br />\nboth buildings were available in<br />\na few weeks. The \"Barn,\" transformed so as to provide a lunchroom, a barber shop, various offices and board rooms,- and a large<br />\ncommon-room which the Y. M. C.<br />\nA. supplies with reading matter<br />\nand a piano, was put under the<br />\ncontrol of the Student Council. It<br />\nconstitutes a self-governing club<br />\nfor undergraduates, comparable in<br />\nservice and convenience to the<br />\nHopkins Club for graduate students and faculty.<br />\nAs was to be expected, the effect upon undergraduate life of removal to Homewood was marked.<br />\nThe largest freshman class yet<br />\nenrolled entered in October, 1916.<br />\nDistinctive caps\u2014black and blue<br />\nwith a yellow button\u2014ordainedby<br />\nthe Student Council for freshmen, were worn for the first<br />\ntime. The requirements of physical training were increased from<br />\none to two years1 and by the organiation of a battalion of the Officers Reserve Training Corps it<br />\nwas made possible for students to<br />\nsecurethe prescribed exercise in the<br />\nform of military training. At the<br />\nrequest of a majority Of the undergraduates, a schedule was<br />\nadopted, experimentally in the<br />\nspring, and continued in October,<br />\naccording to which classes begin<br />\nat 8.30 in the morning and laboratory exercises run from 1 to 4<br />\nP. M. The result is to afford daylight practice for the football<br />\nteam and adequate time for military drill.<br />\nThe dominant interest of all departments of the University during the second half-year was of<br />\ncourse the declaration of war.<br />\nThe trustees had already pledged<br />\ntheir support, and both faculty<br />\nand students regarded the national cause as their first duty. Members of the technical departments<br />\ngave their services at once. Numbers of upper classmen enlisted in<br />\nthe battalion and drills were increased. Various members of the<br />\ncorps received commissions in the<br />\narmy, and many more were subject to call in different units of<br />\nthe National Guard. The faculty<br />\nprovided for the immediate release<br />\nof students who wished to enter<br />\nthe service: and later extended the<br />\nsame privilege to those who were<br />\nneeded in agricultural work.<br /><br />\nAbout 40 per cent. of the undergraduates were thus dismissed,<br />\nand those who remained made<br />\nplans for serious employment during the summer. The lack of a<br />\nstaff from which to fly the colors<br />\nled the Layfield Committee to<br />\nchoose as a fitting memorial to<br />\nRobert Layfield two flag poles to<br />\nstand directly in front of Gilman<br />\nHall. The poles, suitably inscribed, were dedicated in the<br />\npresence of the battalion and a<br />\ncollege audience.<br />\nThe closing weeks were uneventful. Many of the usual<br />\nspring activities were given up,<br />\nnot because they could not be carried on, but because the greater issues in every one's mind made<br />\nthem seem trivial. The celebration of senior week was abandoned. At commencement an unusual number of degrees were conferred in absentia and several to<br />\ncandidates who appeared in military uniform.

Every unmarried person who had a net income in 1917 of more than s1,000<br />\nand every in<br />\nperson whose<br />\nnet income was more than $2,000<br />\nis required by law to make a return to the Collector of Internal<br />\nRevenue for his district. He must<br />\nnot wait for the collector to call<br />\non him or send him a notice. He<br />\nmust voluntarily apply to the collector for the income tax form. If<br />\ncollege men will familiarize themselves with the War Revenue Act<br />\nand point out to their parents and<br />\nothers with whom they come in<br />\ncontact what the law requires<br />\nthem to do they will be rendering<br />\na patriotic service.<br />\nThe purpose of the war tax is..<br />\nidentical with that of the Liberty<br />\nLoan.
