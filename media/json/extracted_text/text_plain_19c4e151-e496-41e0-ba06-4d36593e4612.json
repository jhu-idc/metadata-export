Swindell, Jr., coach of the Dramatic<br />\nClub, to put on an all-Hopkins musical comedy is not out of the question. Haverford, which has no greater number of students than Johns<br />\nHopkins, presents a musical comedy each year.<br />\n<br />\n1,<br />\n<br />\nThe idea should be developed by stages, however. For instance,<br />\nfor the next few years some successes of the past could be presented<br />\nuntil the talent at Homewood could discover itself. Meanwhile, interested alumni and undergraduates could be working. up \"numbers\"<br />\nfor a future all-Hopkins show. The failure of an original musical<br />\nshow next year would kill the idea forever.<br />\n<br />\nCost $10<br />\nyou can sell them<br />\nfor thousands<br />\n<br />\nThe musical show is \"the thing\" for a town where other shows are<br />\nfrequent and where a real college touch is the desired thing. The expense is about three times as great as in the case of the straight show,<br />\nunless student costumes can cut it down.<br />\nMeanwhile, our \"straight\" productions are reaching a point far<br />\nabove that of the average amateur. Since the present coach has taken<br />\nthe reins, dramatics has been a real art; the usual amateur crudities and<br />\ninconsistencies have disappeared, and a really worthwhile production<br />\nhas resulted. \"The Purple Mask\" should set a mark to be looked up<br />\nto only by other - organizati6ns.

Haverford, which has no greater number of students than Johns<br />\nHopkins, presents a musical comedy each year.<br /><br />\n1,<br /><br />\nThe idea should be developed by stages, however. For instance,<br />\nfor the next few years some successes of the past could be presented<br />\nuntil the talent at Homewood could discover itself. Meanwhile, interested alumni and undergraduates could be working. up \"numbers\"<br />\nfor a future all-Hopkins show. The failure of an original musical<br />\nshow next year would kill the idea forever.<br /><br />\nCost $10<br />\nyou can sell them<br />\nfor thousands<br /><br />\nThe musical show is \"the thing\" for a town where other shows are<br />\nfrequent and where a real college touch is the desired thing. The expense is about three times as great as in the case of the straight show,<br />\nunless student costumes can cut it down.<br />\nMeanwhile, our \"straight\" productions are reaching a point far<br />\nabove that of the average amateur. Since the present coach has taken<br />\nthe reins, dramatics has been a real art; the usual amateur crudities and<br />\ninconsistencies have disappeared, and a really worthwhile production<br />\nhas resulted. \"The Purple Mask\" should set a mark to be looked up<br />\nto only by other - organizati6ns.
