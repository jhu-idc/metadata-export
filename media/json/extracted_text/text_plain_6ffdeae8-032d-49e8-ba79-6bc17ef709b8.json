Kirk, U.S. A., Visits Local Student<br />\nBattalion and Commends Work.<br />\nOrders for New Equipment Sent In.<br />\n<br />\nEvery step taken towards the installation of military training at<br />\nHopkins has led to the success of<br />\nthe movement. On last Wednesday the battalion was inspected by<br />\nDean Brush, Captain Kirk of the<br />\nWar Department and members of<br />\nthe faculty, who were all deeply<br />\nimpressed with the enthusiastic yet<br />\nserious manner in which the members of the battalion conducted<br />\nthemselves, and with their ability<br />\nto carry out properly the commands<br />\nof Mr. Kistler and the leaders.<br />\nAfter watching the company drill<br />\nfor a short time, Captain Kirk was<br />\nintroduced by Dr. Abercrombie,<br />\nand spoke to the corps as they stood<br />\nat rest. He said that as it was<br />\ncustomary for the War Department to send men to various colleges to see if they had the proper<br />\nnumber of men and facilities, he<br />\nhad been sent to Hopkins to see<br />\nhow matters stood. Not only did<br />\nhe find facilities, but also that which<br />\nis more necessary, an enthusiastic<br />\ncapable corps of students whom he<br />\nfelt sure would make a success of<br />\nthis movement. Consequently he<br />\nfelt no doubt of the fast that an<br />\nofficer would soon be sent over to<br />\ntake the battalion in charge, since<br />\nthe bill providing for military<br />\ntraining of this kind has already<br />\npassed the House, and will probably<br />\nmeet with little opposition in the<br />\nSenate.<br />\nIn the meantime, the Dean has<br />\nput in a request for 130 rifles,<br />\nwhich will probably arrive at an<br />\nearly date; and although new uniforms cannot be furnished at present, old ones may be sent from<br />\nWashington for the use of the<br />\nmembers of the corps. It has been<br />\nsuggested that in order to secure<br />\nunity of costume for the sake of<br />\nappearance, the students taking the<br />\n'training wear white duck trousers<br />\nand white shirts during the drills<br />\nat . Homewood, which began last<br />\nFriday.<br />\nOn last Monday Mr. Kistler had<br />\nfour of the leaders drill the company and this plan proved very<br />\nsuccessful. As it is Mr. Kistler's<br />\nwish to put the responsibility of the<br />\ndrilling as much as possible upon<br />\nthe men themselves, he will continue in this course, giving the different leaders opportunity to drill<br />\nthe company in order to give the<br />\ncorps members a chance to decide<br />\nwhom they want for 'officers when<br />\nthe battalion is organized.

For a time he was assistant coach at Harvard, and the<br />\nrecords of the teams which he has<br />\ndeveloped at different preparatory<br />\nschools in Baltimore and elsewhere,<br />\nin themselves bear sufficient testimony to his ability in this line of<br />\nfootball work.<br />\nAlthough there were many AllAmerican men available, and although several prominent alumni<br />\napplied for the position, the committee quickly decided upon Mr.<br />\nBrennick. Considering the knowledge and ability Mr. Brennick has<br />\nshown in football matters, their<br />\nchoice is not to be questioned. Furthermore, Mr. Brennick knows<br />\nmore about football conditions at<br />\nHopkins than does any other man,<br />\nwith the exception of Charles<br />\nBrickley, and his services as assistant coach last year under the latter<br />\nwill enable him easily to step into<br />\nthe vacated position.<br />\nBILLY SUNDAY TO SPEAK TO<br />\nSTUDENTS FRIDAY, APRIL 14<br />\n<br />\nIt has been announced that Billy<br />\nSunday will speak at Johns Hopkins University on Friday, April 14,<br />\nat 12 o'clock noon.<br />\nRumors concerning the appearance of Mr. Sunday at McCoy Hall<br />\nhave been spread thoroughout his<br />\ncampaign in Baltimore, and repeated<br />\nefforts have been made to secure<br />\nhim\u2014none succeeding until now.<br />\nA large attendance is expected.<br />\nONLY FEW MORE DAYS TO<br />\nCONTRIBUTE TO MEMORIAL<br />\n<br />\nApril 15 will be the last day on<br />\nwhich contributions to the Layfield<br />\nMemorial Fund will be received.<br />\nThe committee in charge of the<br />\nfund reports that the donations so<br />\nfar have been exceedingly generous,<br />\nbut it is still desirous that every<br />\npossible contribution be forthcoming, in order that the memorial may<br />\nbe a worthy one.<br />\nAll donations should be given to<br />\nTheodore Straus, Hiram Woodward, '16, or Franklin Sutton, '18.<br />\n<br />\nThe annual appropriation of the<br />\nState to Johns Hopkins University<br />\nhas been cut from $25,000 to $15,000.<br />\nImmediately before its adjournment, the Maryland Legislature<br />\npassed a bill which provided for the<br />\nsupport of all the institutions wholly or in part dependent upon the<br />\nState, and it was in this bill that<br />\nthe reduction in the 'Hopkins grant<br />\nwas brought about. Indeed, as<br />\nfirst introduced, the bill provided<br />\nnone of the original grant, and it<br />\nwas only upon amendment that the<br />\nUniversity received any appropriation whatsoever.<br />\nThe $50,000 grant to the Engineering School granted by the<br />\nLegislature is entirely separate<br />\nfrom the $15,000 which is given to<br />\nthe University in general. The former grant is made compulsory by<br />\nthe act of a former Legislature,<br />\nand its renewal is almost automatic.<br />\nThe granting of this fund, however, naturally precludes all talk<br />\nof the withdrawal of the Maryland<br />\nscholarships given by the Engineering School, as these are in no way<br />\naffected by the cut in the general<br />\nappropriation.<br />\nThe action of the Legislature in<br />\nreducing the grant comes as a disappointment to the University, but<br />\nhardly as a surprise. Since the<br />\nopening of the session, a cut in the<br />\nHopkins appropriation had been<br />\nconstantly mentioned as one of the<br />\neasiest methods of reducing the<br />\nState's expenditures, and at first it<br />\nwas feared that the entire grant<br />\nwould be withdrawn. It was due to<br />\nthe appeals of President Goodnow<br />\nand of the Board of Trustees, as<br />\nwell as to the determined fight put<br />\nup within the Legislature itself by<br />\nsuch men as Ex-Speaker Trippe<br />\nand Senator Archer that the $15,000 itself was obtained. rt is understood that the definite stand taken by the Go'vernor in favor of at<br />\nleast a partial grant finally influenced the action of the Legislature.<br />\nWhile the withdrawal of the<br />\n$io,000 , will be a serious loss to<br />\nHopkins, it will not interfere with<br />\nthe removal of the University to<br />\nHomewood next fall. Indeed, it is<br />\nestimated that money would be lost<br />\nby further delay due to the expense<br />\nof keeping the new buildings idle,<br />\nand to the sum which can be realized from the present buildings,<br />\nonce that they are vacated.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Harry Clary Jones, professor<br />\nof physical chemistry ill this University, died suddenly on Sunday,<br />\nApril 9, 1916, the exact cause of<br />\nhis death not being known. Dr.<br />\nJones had been ill for about two<br />\nmonths, but had continued his work<br />\nat the University until ten days before his death, when he was practically forced to remain at his home<br />\nby friends who saw that he was<br />\nrapidly becoming more and more<br />\nnervous.<br />\nFollowing his death, the body was<br />\nsent to the Johns Hopkins Hospital,<br />\nwhere Dr. Wintcrnitz made an investigation into the cause of his<br />\ndeath. Results of the autopsy have<br />\nnot as yet been announced.<br />\nDr. Jones was an incessant worker. He was in the habit of spending every minute possible in the laboratory, and in the course of the<br />\ntwenty-two years that he was a<br />\nmember of the University faculty,<br />\nhe made countless investigations,<br />\npublishing several books and hundreds of papers, many of which give<br />\ndetails of discoveries most important to the advancement of his science. The original work done by<br />\nhim and under his direction probably amounts to more than that any<br />\nother chemist in this country has<br />\nproduced in the same time. At the<br />\ntime of his death he was engaged<br />\nin research which promised to throw<br />\nnew light on several subjects of<br />\nimportance.<br />\nIn spite of the fact that he was<br />\nconstantly using up more nervous<br />\nenergy than that accredited to most<br />\nmen of his age, he would never take<br />\na vacation. Friends and co-workers<br />\non the faculty made repeated attempts to induce him to go to the<br />\nseashore for a period of weeks, in<br />\norder to build up the nervous force<br />\nhe was fast sapping by his constant<br />\ndevotion to his work, but he insisted<br />\nthat it was absolutely necessary for<br />\nhim to continue his daily appearance at the laboratory, and it was<br />\nonly when he became so exceedingly nervous that danger seemed iminent that he consented to remain at<br />\nhis home. During the summer, he<br />\nwould remain in Baltimore, going<br />\ndaily to the University, where he<br />\nworked steadily on whatever problems he had in hand.<br />\nDr. Jones graduated from this<br />\nUniversity as a bachelor of arts in<br />\n1889. and continued his studies here<br />\nuntil the attainment of his doctor's<br />\ndegree, which he received in 1892.<br />\nHe then took up the study of physical chemistry at Leipzig, Stockholm<br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 2)<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, APRIL 10, 1916.<br />\nORGANIZE TO STUDY SOCIALISM<br />\n<br />\nATTENTION!

He<br />\nsketched the purposes, aims and<br />\nmethods of procedure in vogue in<br />\nthe other college Socialist clubs,<br />\nand gave some advice as to how the<br />\nnewly inaugurated club at Hopkins<br />\nmight best proceed in the study of<br />\nSocial:sm. Dr. Laidler had been in<br />\nBelgium in the summer of 1914,<br />\nand he gave a vivid description of<br />\nthe Socialist meetings there on July<br />\n29 of that year, the eve of the great<br />\nEuropean war.<br />\nThe students who have entered<br />\nthis club are not professed Socialists.

These lists were<br />\nfound to be entirely satisfactory,<br />\nand the Council then proceeded to<br />\ndraw up a list of its own for the<br />\ndebate between North Carolina and<br />\nVirginia, which is to take place at<br />\nthis University.<br />\nAlexander A.

To<br />\ninsure interest in the debate, a publicity committee, consisting of Gichner and Oppenheimer, was appointed, and was instructed, as part of<br />\nits work, to mail announcements of<br />\nthe debate to such alumni of North<br />\nCarolina and Virginia as were in<br />\nthe city.<br />\nThe Council then proceeded to<br />\nconsider the offer of the Tau Kappa<br />\nAlpha, which was received about a<br />\nmonth ago.

He pointed to the college spirit which the freshmen have<br />\nhelped to arouse in the University,<br />\nand in closing made a plea for a<br />\nstill better organization for the following year.<br />\nNext, Raymond E. Lenhard<br />\nspoke on the somewhat ambiguous<br />\ntopic \"Why and Wherefore.\" After confessing that he was quite at<br />\na loss as to what subject his topic<br />\nrightly belonged, Lenhard gave a<br />\nbrief review of the vhvs and<br />\nwherefores of class activities.<br />\nAfter this, Adolph L. Hamburger (rave a well delivered and serious talk on \"The Future.\" He<br />\npointed out all the opportunities<br />\nthat lie before the class. Amid<br />\nmuch applause he prophesied that<br />\nthe Class of '19 would have one of<br />\nthe most successful careers of any<br />\nclass that has ever entered Hopkins.<br />\nThe last speech, and one of the<br />\nbest, was that made by Warren<br />\nAllen on \"Calisthenics.\" After<br />\nenumerating all the sports in<br />\nwhich freshmen had displayed an<br />\ninterest, he commented on the victories that the Class of '19 had<br />\nwon. Besides showing how freshmen had starred in football, lacrosse, track and other sports, he<br />\nmade mention of the activities of<br />\nthe basket-ball league and of the<br />\nwrestling club, in which 1919 has<br />\nplayed so prominent a part.<br />\nNext came a toast \"To His<br />\nNamesake,\" by Richard Cox. Then<br />\nRoszel C.

As the building is in need of<br />\nrepairs, a committee consisting of<br />\nMessrs. Cator, Keyser and Radcliffe has been appointed to make<br />\nimprovements. The committee, in<br />\nwhose hands the entire matter has<br />\nbeen left, has had several architects<br />\nto look over the state of affairs and<br />\nto give estimates of the cost of the<br />\nneeded renovations.

If the<br />\nheat could be secured from the<br />\nmain supply-house of the University, it could be gotten more cheaply by the club and would aid the<br />\nUniversity. This idea would necessitate the tearing up of the lawn<br />\nand campus to lay down the big<br />\npipes.

On last Wednesday the battalion was inspected by<br />\nDean Brush, Captain Kirk of the<br />\nWar Department and members of<br />\nthe faculty, who were all deeply<br />\nimpressed with the enthusiastic yet<br />\nserious manner in which the members of the battalion conducted<br />\nthemselves, and with their ability<br />\nto carry out properly the commands<br />\nof Mr. Kistler and the leaders.<br />\nAfter watching the company drill<br />\nfor a short time, Captain Kirk was<br />\nintroduced by Dr. Abercrombie,<br />\nand spoke to the corps as they stood<br />\nat rest. He said that as it was<br />\ncustomary for the War Department to send men to various colleges to see if they had the proper<br />\nnumber of men and facilities, he<br />\nhad been sent to Hopkins to see<br />\nhow matters stood. Not only did<br />\nhe find facilities, but also that which<br />\nis more necessary, an enthusiastic<br />\ncapable corps of students whom he<br />\nfelt sure would make a success of<br />\nthis movement. Consequently he<br />\nfelt no doubt of the fast that an<br />\nofficer would soon be sent over to<br />\ntake the battalion in charge, since<br />\nthe bill providing for military<br />\ntraining of this kind has already<br />\npassed the House, and will probably<br />\nmeet with little opposition in the<br />\nSenate.<br />\nIn the meantime, the Dean has<br />\nput in a request for 130 rifles,<br />\nwhich will probably arrive at an<br />\nearly date; and although new uniforms cannot be furnished at present, old ones may be sent from<br />\nWashington for the use of the<br />\nmembers of the corps. It has been<br />\nsuggested that in order to secure<br />\nunity of costume for the sake of<br />\nappearance, the students taking the<br />\n'training wear white duck trousers<br />\nand white shirts during the drills<br />\nat . Homewood, which began last<br />\nFriday.<br />\nOn last Monday Mr. Kistler had<br />\nfour of the leaders drill the company and this plan proved very<br />\nsuccessful. As it is Mr. Kistler's<br />\nwish to put the responsibility of the<br />\ndrilling as much as possible upon<br />\nthe men themselves, he will continue in this course, giving the different leaders opportunity to drill<br />\nthe company in order to give the<br />\ncorps members a chance to decide<br />\nwhom they want for 'officers when<br />\nthe battalion is organized.

The former grant is made compulsory by<br />\nthe act of a former Legislature,<br />\nand its renewal is almost automatic.<br />\nThe granting of this fund, however, naturally precludes all talk<br />\nof the withdrawal of the Maryland<br />\nscholarships given by the Engineering School, as these are in no way<br />\naffected by the cut in the general<br />\nappropriation.<br />\nThe action of the Legislature in<br />\nreducing the grant comes as a disappointment to the University, but<br />\nhardly as a surprise. Since the<br />\nopening of the session, a cut in the<br />\nHopkins appropriation had been<br />\nconstantly mentioned as one of the<br />\neasiest methods of reducing the<br />\nState's expenditures, and at first it<br />\nwas feared that the entire grant<br />\nwould be withdrawn. It was due to<br />\nthe appeals of President Goodnow<br />\nand of the Board of Trustees, as<br />\nwell as to the determined fight put<br />\nup within the Legislature itself by<br />\nsuch men as Ex-Speaker Trippe<br />\nand Senator Archer that the $15,000 itself was obtained. rt is understood that the definite stand taken by the Go'vernor in favor of at<br />\nleast a partial grant finally influenced the action of the Legislature.<br />\nWhile the withdrawal of the<br />\n$io,000 , will be a serious loss to<br />\nHopkins, it will not interfere with<br />\nthe removal of the University to<br />\nHomewood next fall. Indeed, it is<br />\nestimated that money would be lost<br />\nby further delay due to the expense<br />\nof keeping the new buildings idle,<br />\nand to the sum which can be realized from the present buildings,<br />\nonce that they are vacated.<br /><br />\nDr. Harry Clary Jones, professor<br />\nof physical chemistry ill this University, died suddenly on Sunday,<br />\nApril 9, 1916, the exact cause of<br />\nhis death not being known. Dr.<br />\nJones had been ill for about two<br />\nmonths, but had continued his work<br />\nat the University until ten days before his death, when he was practically forced to remain at his home<br />\nby friends who saw that he was<br />\nrapidly becoming more and more<br />\nnervous.<br />\nFollowing his death, the body was<br />\nsent to the Johns Hopkins Hospital,<br />\nwhere Dr. Wintcrnitz made an investigation into the cause of his<br />\ndeath. Results of the autopsy have<br />\nnot as yet been announced.<br />\nDr. Jones was an incessant worker. He was in the habit of spending every minute possible in the laboratory, and in the course of the<br />\ntwenty-two years that he was a<br />\nmember of the University faculty,<br />\nhe made countless investigations,<br />\npublishing several books and hundreds of papers, many of which give<br />\ndetails of discoveries most important to the advancement of his science. The original work done by<br />\nhim and under his direction probably amounts to more than that any<br />\nother chemist in this country has<br />\nproduced in the same time. At the<br />\ntime of his death he was engaged<br />\nin research which promised to throw<br />\nnew light on several subjects of<br />\nimportance.<br />\nIn spite of the fact that he was<br />\nconstantly using up more nervous<br />\nenergy than that accredited to most<br />\nmen of his age, he would never take<br />\na vacation. Friends and co-workers<br />\non the faculty made repeated attempts to induce him to go to the<br />\nseashore for a period of weeks, in<br />\norder to build up the nervous force<br />\nhe was fast sapping by his constant<br />\ndevotion to his work, but he insisted<br />\nthat it was absolutely necessary for<br />\nhim to continue his daily appearance at the laboratory, and it was<br />\nonly when he became so exceedingly nervous that danger seemed iminent that he consented to remain at<br />\nhis home. During the summer, he<br />\nwould remain in Baltimore, going<br />\ndaily to the University, where he<br />\nworked steadily on whatever problems he had in hand.<br />\nDr. Jones graduated from this<br />\nUniversity as a bachelor of arts in<br />\n1889. and continued his studies here<br />\nuntil the attainment of his doctor's<br />\ndegree, which he received in 1892.<br />\nHe then took up the study of physical chemistry at Leipzig, Stockholm<br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 2)<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, APRIL 10, 1916.<br />\nORGANIZE TO STUDY SOCIALISM<br /><br />\nATTENTION!

He<br />\nsketched the purposes, aims and<br />\nmethods of procedure in vogue in<br />\nthe other college Socialist clubs,<br />\nand gave some advice as to how the<br />\nnewly inaugurated club at Hopkins<br />\nmight best proceed in the study of<br />\nSocial:sm. Dr. Laidler had been in<br />\nBelgium in the summer of 1914,<br />\nand he gave a vivid description of<br />\nthe Socialist meetings there on July<br />\n29 of that year, the eve of the great<br />\nEuropean war.<br />\nThe students who have entered<br />\nthis club are not professed Socialists.

These lists were<br />\nfound to be entirely satisfactory,<br />\nand the Council then proceeded to<br />\ndraw up a list of its own for the<br />\ndebate between North Carolina and<br />\nVirginia, which is to take place at<br />\nthis University.<br />\nAlexander A. Steinbach, the secretary-treasurer of the Council,<br />\nwas made the manager of the Hopkins teams. An entertainment committee, consisting of Gichner, Steinbach and Oppenheimer, was next<br />\nappointed by the president to provide for the reception of the visiting teams, and to make arrangements for their accommodation<br />\nduring their stay in Baltimore. To<br />\ninsure interest in the debate, a publicity committee, consisting of Gichner and Oppenheimer, was appointed, and was instructed, as part of<br />\nits work, to mail announcements of<br />\nthe debate to such alumni of North<br />\nCarolina and Virginia as were in<br />\nthe city.<br />\nThe Council then proceeded to<br />\nconsider the offer of the Tau Kappa<br />\nAlpha, which was received about a<br />\nmonth ago. After some discussion,<br />\nit was decided that the number of<br />\nmen on the Hopkins teams who remained in the University for any<br />\nlength of time was too small to<br />\nallow an active chapter to be founded, and that the official blue \"H\"<br />\ngiven by the University to all 'Varsity debaters was in itself sufficient<br />\nhonor.<br />\nA- plan, which was advanced at<br />\nthe meeting and which was received favorably by the Council,<br />\nproposed to allim. each man upon<br />\nwhom such an .1 I\" was bestowed<br />\nto wear a snmll gold \"II\" either<br />\nupon his watch-guard or his fob.<br />\nThese \"Hs\" are awarded for debating- at many of the larger<br />\n'<br />\n: 1101)leg-es, and are highly prized<br />\nwould, of course, be enkins<br />\ntirely distinct from any athletic insignia, as the Gothic points of the<br />\nblue \"II\" would be preserved.<br />\nThe University of Missouri now<br />\nhas a lunch room which can serve<br />\nabout soo students.

Kirk, Jr., the<br />\ntoastmaster, gave the opening<br />\nspeech to the last \"I Iullabaloo\" with<br />\na \"Hopkins on the end.\"<br />\nAfter the coffee, the toastmaster announced the first speaker of<br />\nthe evening, Ronald Cox, whose<br />\nsubject was \"The Class.\" Cox<br />\ngave a general review of what the<br />\nClass of '19 has accomplished in<br />\nthe way of scholastic and athletic<br />\nendeavors. He pointed to the college spirit which the freshmen have<br />\nhelped to arouse in the University,<br />\nand in closing made a plea for a<br />\nstill better organization for the following year.<br />\nNext, Raymond E. Lenhard<br />\nspoke on the somewhat ambiguous<br />\ntopic \"Why and Wherefore.\" After confessing that he was quite at<br />\na loss as to what subject his topic<br />\nrightly belonged, Lenhard gave a<br />\nbrief review of the vhvs and<br />\nwherefores of class activities.<br />\nAfter this, Adolph L. Hamburger (rave a well delivered and serious talk on \"The Future.\" He<br />\npointed out all the opportunities<br />\nthat lie before the class. Amid<br />\nmuch applause he prophesied that<br />\nthe Class of '19 would have one of<br />\nthe most successful careers of any<br />\nclass that has ever entered Hopkins.<br />\nThe last speech, and one of the<br />\nbest, was that made by Warren<br />\nAllen on \"Calisthenics.\" After<br />\nenumerating all the sports in<br />\nwhich freshmen had displayed an<br />\ninterest, he commented on the victories that the Class of '19 had<br />\nwon. Besides showing how freshmen had starred in football, lacrosse, track and other sports, he<br />\nmade mention of the activities of<br />\nthe basket-ball league and of the<br />\nwrestling club, in which 1919 has<br />\nplayed so prominent a part.<br />\nNext came a toast \"To His<br />\nNamesake,\" by Richard Cox. Then<br />\nRoszel C.

Herbert Baxley. With a few wellchosen remarks he gave a toast to<br />\nthe Class of '18, wishing them the<br />\nbest of luck 'and a successful future. After the applause had died.<br />\ndown, Mitchell B.
