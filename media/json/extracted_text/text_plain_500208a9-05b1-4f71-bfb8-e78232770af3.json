However, a recent development indicates that we, as students, are perhaps not<br />\nentitled to all the privileges that such supposed maturity would suggest. Specifically,<br />\nour right to privacy is not as secure as we<br />\nmight assume.<br />\nWithin the last week, an electronic letter,<br />\nwritten by an undergraduate and intended<br />\nconfidentially, was brought to the attention<br />\nof the Director of Homewood Computing<br />\nServices David Binko. The letter was<br />\ndiscovered to contain perjorative references<br />\nto Binko, who subsequently sent a vicious<br />\nletter to the author threatening retaliation.<br />\nThat Binko used his position and the University computer system for his own vindictive<br />\nends is reprehensible and should be seriously questioned.<br />\nBinko cannot be blamed for reading the<br />\nletter; it was incorrectly addressed and it is<br />\npolicy to check the file under these circumstances. However, the fact that he wrote<br />\na letter in response is questionable and does<br />\nnot demonstrate a great deal of forethought.<br />\nYet even this action is pardonable, given the<br />\n<br />\ncontent of the letter, but the notion that the<br />\nletter was used to threaten the author is<br />\nindefensible.<br />\nBinko claims that the letter was not intended to threaten, though the text would<br />\nsuggest otherwise. Binko indicates that he<br />\nmay take actions \"to limit (the author's)<br />\ncommunications to the outside world\" by<br />\ncancelling the student's computer account.<br />\nSuch implication is childish and<br />\nirresponsible.<br />\nThe Student Council, upon learning of<br />\nthese events, passed a resolution Wednesday<br />\nnight stating that electronic COT respondence<br />\nand student computer files be kept confidential and that the Council considers \"any unnecessary intrusion by computer system officials into the accounts intolerable.\"<br />\nCouncil has the right idea, but the<br />\nrepresentatives advocate far too little. It must<br />\nbe made undeniably clear in the future that<br />\nthe Homewood computer system is not to<br />\nbe used for personal ends by computer officials. A public reprimand of the Director<br />\nshould be issued by the Homewood deans.<br />\nA formal apology to the involved student<br />\nshould be forwarded. Finally, undergraduates should be officially assured of<br />\ntheir right to privacy since it appears that little can be taken for granted at this<br />\ninstitution.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\naltogether.

Without having open parparties three or four years ago ties and \"wet\" rush, though, it<br />\nwould have ended in massive would be very difficult for frats<br />\ndestruction to the frat houses, to survive. Freshmen don't<br />\nlitter scattered all over the wander over to the house on<br />\nneighborhoods around the their own to meet the brothers,<br />\nfrats, and a fair number of and most freshmen don't even<br />\nfreshmen (and upperclassmen) consider frats when they first<br />\nbeing taken to Union come here. The frats need the<br />\nopen parties as advertisement to<br />\nMemorial.<br />\nDespite the relative reserve show people they exist as an<br />\nthat marks frat parties now, alternative for after freshman<br />\nthese fines, Coupled with the year.<br />\nThe school, however, seems<br />\nprospect of a TRULY dry rush<br />\n(as opposed to last year's perfectly content to do away<br />\nnominally dry rush)seem to be with open parties and, perhaps,<br />\npart of a school policy design- even let frats die. Since I've<br />\ned to phase out open parties been here, one frat (almost two)<br />\n<br />\nFrat Applause<br />\n<br />\nhas lost its house, while two<br />\nfrats have closed up. The administration seems perfectly<br />\nhappy with this, seeming to say,<br />\n\"Well, they're all animals<br />\nanyway.\" Never mind that the<br />\npresidents of the senior, junior,<br />\nand sophomore classes are frat<br />\nmembers, as are many<br />\nhousemasters. The image that<br />\none sees of frats is still one of<br />\nmale chauvinists wreaking<br />\nhavoc and debauching.<br />\nThe administration depends<br />\nvitally upon frats, and yet it still<br />\nadvocates \"frat bashing.\"<br />\nFrats supplement the social life<br />\nof the school greatly, one frat<br />\nalone having a bigger social<br />\nbudget than the school does.<br />\nMany Hopkins institutions,<br />\nsuch as Spring Fair, depend on<br />\nfrats. The administration saves<br />\nthousands by paying frats,<br />\nrather than outside contractors,<br />\nto provide security, parking,<br />\nand clean-up for the fair. When<br />\nthe administration decides to<br />\nshirk some more responsibility<br />\nby having students act as security on the quads at night, the<br />\nfrats are the first ones they turn<br />\nto for help. Despite all that<br />\nfrats do for the school, the administration still seems bent on<br />\nletting them die out.<br />\nAfter a few years here,<br />\nthough, this sort of stuff<br />\ndoesn't surprise one. After seeing all sorts of social activities<br />\n<br />\ndie out(Chester's Place and the<br />\nChaplain's Office Spring Concert), the Hut attacked, tuition<br />\nraised about a thousand bucks<br />\na year (from $5700 to $8600<br />\nsince I've been here), and the<br />\nradio station go off the air (it<br />\nwouldn't be on in a few months<br />\nif the license weren't threatened), it wouldn't be too shocking to see Hopkins go fratless<br />\ntoo.<br />\nIt's disturbing sometimes<br />\nthat people don't get too mad<br />\nabout these sort of happenings.<br />\nThe University comes up with<br />\na farcical security proposal,<br />\nwanting now to use work-study<br />\npeople as quad monitors in a city with the second highest crime<br />\nrate in the nation, and people<br />\ndon't complain. We'll probably<br />\nhave to wait until somebody<br />\ngets killed on a quad (rapes on<br />\ncampus apparently are not<br />\nenough) to get a real security<br />\nimprovement. People here<br />\ncomplain a bit, but are too worried about grades to ever really<br />\nprotest. When a real controversy comes along, as with the<br />\nwomen's center, the school lynches a few people, succeeds in<br />\navoiding the real issues, and<br />\neveryone soon forgets about it.<br />\nNow, the frats get lynched.

He was<br />\nrecently reelected by a vast<br />\nmargin and enjoys a long-term<br />\napproval rating unmatched by<br />\nany recent president. Yet, much<br />\nof his popularity is personal,<br />\nnot based on his political positions. These positions individually and collectively make<br />\none wonder about his<br />\npossibilities for success on the<br />\nissues during the second term.<br />\nLet's begin with the balanced budget amendment. Reagan<br />\nhas continually supported such<br />\nan amendment, but he has<br />\nnever submitted a budget to<br />\nCongress with less than a $150<br />\nbillion dollar deficit. As a matter of fact, deficits have doubled under Reagan. Thus,<br />\nReagan's advocacy of a balanced budget amendment can only be seen as wishful thinking.<br />\nReagan has also consistently<br />\nendorsed a military buildup for<br />\na \"strong\" defense. Therefore,<br />\nthe military budget has increased dramatically since Reagan<br />\ntook office. Few would\u2022 argue<br />\nwith Reagan's motives or intentions, but the buildup's scope<br />\nand relative size have been<br />\nquestioned. Does it make sense<br />\nto spend $30 billion on the MX<br />\nmissile, when Congress and the<br />\nmilitary entertain very serious<br />\nand substantial doubts about<br />\nthe vulnerability of the missile?<br />\nThe President defends the<br />\nsystem as a \"bargaining chip\"<br />\nand wishes to see it continued<br />\nbecause cancellation of the program would send the wrong<br />\n\"signals\" to Moscow about<br />\nU.S. \"toughness.\" Is such a<br />\ndubious explanation worth $30<br />\nbillion? Other reasons have<br />\nbeen forwarded, but none by<br />\nthe President himself. Congress<br />\ndisagrees with the President on<br />\nthis issue. Even Senator Barry<br />\nGoldwater of Arizona, a<br />\nhawkish conservative, has<br />\nstated that the MX has little<br />\nchance of passing (Time,<br />\n1-28-85, p. 22). Reagan,<br />\nhowever, still counts the MX as<br />\nan important part of his overall<br />\n<br />\nmilitary program.<br />\nDefense spending is also tied<br />\nin with the deficit. The high rate<br />\nof spending is a major factor in<br />\nthe deficit's increase. Reagan<br />\nhas accepted as gospel the insignificant reductions in the<br />\nmilitary budget proposed by<br />\nCaspar Weinberger. Reagan<br />\nseems to feel that this savings is<br />\nmore than enough. No<br />\nweapons system was touched,<br />\nnor was military pay. Yet,<br />\nReagan has imposed a reduction of 5% on federal<br />\nemployees' salaries and is omitting the usual COLA increase.<br />\nIf Reagan feels that this is<br />\nnecessary to reduce the deficit,<br />\nhow can the military budget be<br />\nleft essentially untouched when<br />\nso many other programs like<br />\nfunds for education and health<br />\ncare are being slashed to the<br />\nbone. Even though the military<br />\nis well known for procurement<br />\ninefficiency ($4000 dollar coffeemakers)and waste as well as<br />\nweapons that are too delicate or<br />\ncomplicated. This question has<br />\nbeen left generally unanswered<br />\nby Reagan. Other Republicans,<br />\nhowever, say that the military<br />\nwill have to shoulder a larger<br />\npart of the deficit reduction or<br />\nthe new budget will not pass<br />\neither the Senate or the House.<br />\nThus, another of Reagan's platforms is in trouble.<br />\nThe President, in a recent<br />\nradio interview, stated that<br />\nblacks voted against him<br />\nbecause they misunderstood his<br />\npolicies and exactly how much<br />\nhe has done for them. One of<br />\nthe statistics he used was that of<br />\nthe six million people who<br />\nfound jobs in the last four<br />\nyears, one million of them were<br />\nblack (New York Times,<br />\n1-27-85, p. Al2). Another<br />\nstatistic used in the interview is<br />\nthe fact that black unemployment is 2\u00bd times white<br />\nunemployment. Blacks make<br />\nup nearly thirty percent of the<br />\ntotal unemployed, yet they<br />\nreceive only sixteen percent of<br />\nthe new jobs. Thus, black<br />\nunemployment vis-a-vis whites<br />\nis becoming worse, not better as<br />\nthe President implies.

In my opinion, the<br />\nblacks' voting record in 1984<br />\nwas not because of misrepresentation or as a sign of<br />\nmisunderstanding, but as a<br />\nrealization of their own interests.

In The Fallacy of Star<br />\nWars, the Union of Concerned<br />\nScientists delivers an interesting, straight-to-the-point<br />\nand easy to read analysis of the<br />\nSDI, otherwise known as \"Star<br />\nWars.\" The topic is attacked<br />\nfrom all angles, offering convincing evidence for the scientist, the economist, and the<br />\npolitician.<br />\n<br />\nThe book is neatly divided<br />\ninto three parts. The first is an<br />\nintroduction which gives a brief<br />\nreview of the history of nuclear<br />\nweapons and the arms race. Included in this section are summaries of the Anti-Ballistic<br />\nMissile (ABM) and Strategic<br />\nArms Limitation Treaties<br />\n(SALT) and their effects.<br />\nThe second and third sections<br />\nare the real meat of the book.<br />\nPart two provides an in-depth<br />\nlook at spaced-based missile<br />\ndefense systems, such as those<br />\ncurrently being investigated by<br />\nthe Department of Defense.<br />\nThese include X-ray lasers,<br />\nchemical lasers, orbiting battle<br />\nstations, and pop-up interception devices. Each one of these<br />\nsystems is analyzed as to how<br />\n<br />\nExcerpt<br />\n.The election of Ronald<br />\nReagan in 1980 brought to<br />\npower a group ideologically<br />\nhostile to arms control, convinced of Soviet bad faith,<br />\nand committed to a major<br />\nU.S. nuclear builup to<br />\nreverse what it saw as a trend<br />\ntoward Soviet superiority.<br />\nThe arms control talks of the<br />\n1970s, in the view of the new<br />\nadministration, had lulled<br />\nthe United States into what<br />\namounted to unilateral<br />\ndisarmament while the<br />\nSoviet Union relentlessly<br />\nforged ahead with a military<br />\nbuildup. This was a highly<br />\nskewed version of recent<br />\nhistory, in view of the huge<br />\nU.S. warhead buildup during the 1970s, which was ac-<br />\n<br />\ntually larger than the<br />\nSoviets', but it was politically potent. The barrage of accusations against the arms<br />\ncontrol process inevitably<br />\nexposed the ABM Treaty\u2014<br />\nthe most visable symbol of<br />\nthat process\u2014to a formidable attack. There were<br />\nearly hints from the new administration, reinforced by<br />\nthe prominence it gave to the<br />\nso-called<br />\nwindow<br />\nof<br />\nvulnerability facing U.S.<br />\nland-based missiles, that<br />\nABM deployment would<br />\nreceive serious consideration. In a clear departure<br />\nfrom its predecessors, the<br />\nReagan White House did not<br />\ntreat the 1972 treaty as<br />\nsacrosanct.\"<br />\n<br />\nthey operate and how they<br />\nwould have to be deployed to<br />\nbe effective. There are two<br />\nchapters in this section which<br />\ndeal with the technological<br />\naspects of the weapons. These<br />\nmay be hard for some people to<br />\nfollow. The authors even suggest that readers less interested<br />\nin the scientific details can skip<br />\nover those chapters. They really are not that hard to follow<br />\nand probably anyone with a<br />\nhigh school background in<br />\nphysics should have no problem<br />\ngetting through those chapters.<br />\nHowever, they can be passed<br />\nover without really detracting<br />\nfrom the major points of the<br />\nbook.<br />\nIn order to build or evaluate<br />\na defense system, one must<br />\nknow the offense very well. For<br />\nthis reason the authors include<br />\na detailed description of the<br />\nmechanisms and vulnerabilities<br />\nof Inter-Continental Ballistic<br />\nMissiles(ICBMs). This is essential to understanding the<br />\ncapabilities and shortcomings<br />\nof the defense systems<br />\ndiscussed.<br />\nOne interesting chapter is entitled \"Physics and Geometry<br />\nversus Secrecy and Clairvoyance.\" This short section<br />\nexplains how the scientists can<br />\neffectively appraise the spacebased missile defense systems<br />\nusing only scientific laws and<br />\nfacts, with no access to<br />\nclassified military information.<br />\nThe most informative part of<br />\nthe second section is where the<br />\nauthors propose countermeasures which the Soviets<br />\nwould probably use to undermine any of the defense<br />\nsystems.

Y'see, there are a lot<br />\nof sixties rejects around this<br />\ncampus. I'm one of the few<br />\nwho considers himself lucky to<br />\nbe a beat reject. This book,<br />\ntherefore, is a godsend.<br />\nThe editor of Kerouac and<br />\nFriends, Fred W. McDarrah,<br />\nused to be a photographer for<br />\nthe Village Voice. He lived in<br />\nGreenwich<br />\nVillage, the<br />\nresidence of the Beats, during<br />\ntheir short-lived New York heyday. His<br />\nphotographic<br />\nbackground helps his book. Interspersed between Mr. McDarrah's photographs are short<br />\nessays from the period. They<br />\nrange from the loving analyses<br />\nof the Beatnik journalists to the<br />\ndamning views of the<br />\n\"establishment,\" and therein<br />\n<br />\nExcerpt<br />\n\"...The origins of the word<br />\n'beat' are obscure, but the<br />\nmeaning is only too clear to<br />\nmost Americans. More than<br />\nmere weariness, it implies<br />\nthe feeling of having been<br />\nused, of being raw. It involves a sort of nakedness of<br />\nmind, and, ultimately, of<br />\nsoul; a feeling of being<br />\nreduced to the bedrock of<br />\nconsciousness. In short, it<br />\nmeans being undramatically<br />\npushed up against the wall of<br />\noneself. A man is beat<br />\nwhenever he goes for broke<br />\nand wagers the sum of his<br />\nresources on a single<br />\nnumber; and the young<br />\ngeneration has done that<br />\ncontinually from early<br />\nyouth.\"<br />\nlies the key to his work.<br />\nThis book could have been a<br />\nnostalgic and loving look back<br />\nby a Beatnik for Beatniks. Instead, McDarrah makes sure<br />\nthat the bad views of the Beat-<br />\n<br />\nniks aren't the maniacal views<br />\nthat people usually have for rejects. Thus, we get the kind of<br />\nview that treats the Beats not as<br />\na hula-hoop type fad, but as an<br />\nimportant movement that set<br />\nthe stage for the social and<br />\npolitical changes of the sixties.<br />\nAs David McReynolds wrote:<br />\n\". . .[The beat generation by<br />\nits very existence serves notice<br />\non all of us who are political<br />\nthat if we want to involve youth<br />\nin politics we must develop a<br />\npolitics of action.

Dr.<br />\nAllan Drash, head of the<br />\nDepartment of Endocrinology<br />\nat Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, was one of the participants. Drash is the immediate past president of the<br />\nAmerican Diabetes Association, and one of the world's<br />\nleading experts .in the field of<br />\n<br />\nas a result of the disorder.<br />\nElimination of these complications is the basis of the many<br />\nresearch efforts going on<br />\naround the world. Since virtually all victims of diabetes under<br />\nthe age of 20 are insulindependent, much research is<br />\ndirected at these young people,<br />\nwho stand the greatest chance<br />\ndeveloping<br />\nfuture<br />\nof<br />\ncomplications.<br />\nCAUSE<br />\nThe first 'C' is cause, or<br />\netiology of diabetes. Research<br />\n<br />\nAmerican Diabetes Association<br />\n<br />\nDr. Allan Drash of the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.<br />\n<br />\nchildhood diabetes.<br />\nDrash summarizes the many<br />\ndifferent aspects of diabetes<br />\nresearch in terms of the \"five<br />\nC's\": cause, course, care, complications, and cure. These five<br />\nheadings encompass most of<br />\nthe current issues involving the<br />\ndisorder.<br />\nDiabetes mellitus results<br />\nwhen the beta cells of the pancreas slow down or stop producing insulin, the hormone<br />\nwhich allows the body to<br />\nmetabolize carbohydrates.<br />\nThe milder form of the<br />\ndisorder, known as Type II<br />\ndiabetes, is thought to occur<br />\nwhen the patient's body cells<br />\nare resistant to the insulin produced by the pancreas, or when<br />\nthe pancreas itself produces a<br />\nlow amount of insulin. Found<br />\nmostly in older adults, its control can usually be achieved by<br />\npills or diet alone.<br />\nIn insulin-dependent diabetes<br />\nmellitus(IDDM), however, the<br />\npancreas completely stops producing the hormone and the patient must rely on daily injections of insulin to stay alive.<br />\nAlthough these injections do<br />\nkeep the patient alive, in no<br />\nway can they be considered a<br />\ncure. Diabetics often experience<br />\nhigher than normal levels of<br />\nblood sugar. They are also subject to spells of low blood sugar<br />\nknown as insulin reactions,<br />\nwhich can cause brain damage<br />\nor death if not treated with<br />\nsugar immediately.<br />\nMany long-term complications, such as kidney damage,<br />\natherosclerosis, eye damage,<br />\nand neuropathy can also occur<br />\n<br />\nis particularly aimed at determining the factors involved in<br />\nbeta cell damage. Although little is known for sure, it is<br />\ngenerally, believed that genetic<br />\npredisposition, viral infections,<br />\nand autoimmune destruction of<br />\nbeta cells interact with environmental factors to cause<br />\ndiabetes.<br />\nOne interesting finding is<br />\nthat a certain gene involved in<br />\nthe immune system, the HLADR, is of two particular types<br />\nin diabetics. Almost all IDDM<br />\npatients possess either HLADR 3, HLA-DR 4, or both.<br />\nThis would obviously suggest<br />\ngenetic predisposition to the<br />\ndisorder. Furthermore, it seems<br />\nthat the two types of genes<br />\nthemselves differ in the<br />\nunderlying etiology and clinical<br />\ncourse of the patient's diabetes.<br />\nWhile HLA-DR 3 is associated<br />\nwith a chronic, ongoing,<br />\nautoimmune process, HLA-DR<br />\n4 patients are more likely to<br />\ndevelop diabetes by an acute infectious process. This provides<br />\nevidence<br />\nthat<br />\ngenetic<br />\npredisposition may interact<br />\nwith autoimmune, viral, or environmental factors in the<br />\ndestruction of beta cells.<br />\nMany specific viruses have<br />\nbeen implicated in relation to<br />\ndiabetes, including the coxsackie group, mumps, rubella,<br />\ninfluenza, and hepatitis. In<br />\n1973, during an epidemic of<br />\nReye's Syndrome which occurred across the northeastern.<br />\nUnited States, five out of twenty afflicted children who died at<br />\nChildren's Hospital in Pittsburgh also presented symptoms<br />\nof diabetes mellitus. It was later<br />\ndiscovered that the primary initiating virus for Reye's Syndrome was Influenza B, thus<br />\nsuggesting a link between this<br />\nvirus and diabetes.<br />\n<br />\nEnvironmental factors are<br />\nalso implicated in the causation<br />\nof diabetes. Certain pollutants<br />\nand toxins have been shown to<br />\ncause the disorder in laboratory<br />\nanimals. Several individuals<br />\nbecame diabetic after attempting suicide by ingesting vacor,<br />\na type of rat poison. Some<br />\nnitrosamines in food have also<br />\nbeen implicated in beta-cell<br />\ndamage.<br />\nAnother interesting finding is<br />\nthe enormous variation in expression of IDDM around the<br />\nworld. The highest attack rate<br />\nis in Finland, where 40 cases occur for every 100,000 children<br />\neach year. In Pittsburgh, the<br />\nrate is 15 per 100,000, while in<br />\nJapan, less than 1 case per<br />\n100,000 occurs each year. These<br />\ndifferences can't be explained<br />\nby genetic factors alone; the<br />\nprimary explanation must lie in<br />\nthe environment.<br />\nOne difference in the various<br />\ncountries is in the mode of<br />\nnutrition. Animal studies have<br />\nshown that dietary manipulation has a large impact on the<br />\nexpression of diabetes. A study<br />\nin Copenhagen found that<br />\nbreast-feeding may have a protective mechanism against<br />\ndiabetes, or that absence of<br />\nbreast-feeding may lead to increased susceptibility in individuals who already have the<br />\nunderlying defect. Evidence for<br />\nthis includes the fact that the<br />\nfrequency of IDDM increases<br />\nthe further a population is from<br />\nthe equator. This corresponds<br />\nto the increase in industrialized<br />\nareas, which, in turn, means a<br />\ndecrease in the tendency of<br />\nmothers in a population to<br />\nbreast-feed. In Samoa, where<br />\nthere are no cows, all children<br />\nare breast-fed. There are no<br />\n<br />\nIDDM victims in Samoa. When<br />\nSamoans move to another<br />\ncountry, however, future<br />\ngenerations begin to develop<br />\ndiabetes at a rate equivalent to<br />\nthe rate in that country.<br />\n<br />\nHighlights<br />\n<br />\n(Premiere!!!); 8:00p.m.:<br />\nNature\u2014Birds of Paradox.<br />\n<br />\nPublic TV\u2014Science and<br />\nNature Programs<br />\n<br />\nMon., Feb. 4, 7:30p.m.:<br />\nWild, Wild World of<br />\nAnimals\u2014What the Dolphin<br />\nKnows.<br />\n<br />\nChannel 67, Baltimore<br />\nFri.,<br />\nFeb.<br />\n1,<br />\n7:30p.m.:Wild, Wild World<br />\nof Animals\u2014The Floating<br />\nWilderness.<br />\nSat., Feb. 2, 8:30a.m.:<br />\nOceanus\u2014The Water Planet,<br />\nCosmic Origins; 1:30p.m.:<br />\nNew Tech Times; 2:00p.m.:<br />\nThe Nature of Things II;<br />\n3:00p.m.: Nova (R)\u2014The<br />\nConquest of the Parasites;<br />\n4:30p.m.: Academy on<br />\nComputers\u2014What Next ?;<br />\n8:00p.m.: The Undersea<br />\nWorld<br />\nof<br />\nJacques<br />\nCousteau\u2014Sharks; 9:00p.m.:<br />\nNature(R)\u2014Flight of the<br />\nBumblebee.<br />\nSun., Feb. 3, 9:30a.m.:<br />\nAcademy on Computers(R);<br />\n10:00a.m.: The New Literacy:<br />\nAn<br />\nIntroduction<br />\nto<br />\nComputers\u2014The Computing<br />\nMachine, Part II, Communicating with a Computer;<br />\n7:00p.m.: The Living Planet:<br />\nA Portrait of the Earth\u2014The<br />\nBuilding of the Earth<br />\n<br />\nCOURSE<br />\nMany studies are currently<br />\naimed at determining what happens to the diabetic over time.<br />\nOne current focus is the honeymoon or remission of the<br />\ndisease.

The Trident I and<br />\nTrident II missiles \"are as different as a lightning-bug and<br />\nlightning.\" Both are submarine<br />\nlaunched ballistic missiles<br />\n.(SLBM), and have a range of<br />\nbetween 4000 a-r-Icl 6300 nautical<br />\nmiles. Lockheed is the primary<br />\ncontractor for both.<br />\nThe most significant difference is in accuracy. The Trident I had an accuracy of approximately 500 meters, sufficient for retaliatory strikes<br />\nagainst almost any economic<br />\ntarget (including cities, factories, etc.), but useless against<br />\nany hardened missile silos. The<br />\nTrident II has an accuracy of<br />\napproximately 150 meters,<br />\nwhich is sufficient to destroy<br />\nhardened missile silos.<br />\nThe payload is different. The<br />\nTrident I carries eight<br />\n100-kiloton warheads (the<br />\nbombs dropped on Hiroshima<br />\nand Nagasaki were about 12<br />\nkilotons), the Trident II carries<br />\neither 14 100-kiloton warheads,<br />\nor 9 33-kiloton warheads<br />\n(which are necessary to destroy<br />\n\"hard\" targets, such as missiles<br />\nin their silos).<br />\nThomas J. Downey,<br />\nDemocratic Congressman from<br />\nNew York, says that the Trident II is destabilizing because<br />\nit \"increases the probability of<br />\n<br />\nstrategic nuclear war by<br />\nthreatening to prevent the other<br />\nside from retaliating. Thus, it<br />\ngives the owner the incentive to<br />\nuse it in a crisis, and leaves its<br />\nintended victim no option but<br />\nto beat it to the punch.\"<br />\nThe destabilizing effect of<br />\nTrident II is compounded by<br />\nthe fact that it is submarinelaunched. They position<br />\nthemselves just off Soviet<br />\nshores, reducing the flight time,<br />\nnecessitating what is called<br />\n\"launch-in-warning\" on the<br />\nSoviets' part. In other words,<br />\nthe decision to launch their<br />\nweapons must be made in<br />\nunder 15 minutes. This means<br />\nthat if the Soviets do not want<br />\ntheir missiles and bombers<br />\ndestroyed on the ground, they<br />\n<br />\n\"It is true that the<br />\nAPL is involred in the<br />\ndevelopment of Trident and cruise<br />\nmissiles, but that is only in the area of<br />\nresearch<br />\nand<br />\ndevelopment.\"<br />\n-Carl 0. Bostrom,<br />\nDirector of APL<br />\nwould have to launch their<br />\nweapons whenever they<br />\nperceive a U. S. attack. The<br />\nshorter the flight time, the less<br />\ntime is left to make sure that an<br />\nattack is occurring, and the<br />\ngreater the possibility of war<br />\nstarting by accident.(A flock of<br />\ngeese, mistaken as Soviet<br />\nmissiles, came close to starting<br />\na nuclear war not long ago.)<br />\nThe Reagan Administration<br />\nsees \"Trident II, like the MX,<br />\nas a weapon that will open up<br />\nopportunities for flexibility in<br />\narms control negotiations with<br />\nMoscow.\" (New York Times,<br />\nSeptember 9, 4984, p.

The<br />\nmembers of the Conversion<br />\nProject see the production of<br />\nTrident II as just a further<br />\nescalation of the arms race,<br />\nmaking the task of arms control<br />\neven more difficult.

By order of the<br />\nBaltimore City Police Department, they must keep moving;<br />\nalthough this rule is rarely<br />\nfollowed strictly, most do walk<br />\nabout.<br />\nSome of the protesters content themselves to actual<br />\npicketing: carrying signs and<br />\nthe like.

This<br />\nentails stating clearly to the patients \"I am with the clinic. I'll<br />\nescort you into the clinic if you<br />\nlike\" so that clients do not confuse who is who on the<br />\nsidewalk. It entails keeping<br />\none's temper, even when protesters harass you; it means not<br />\nresponding to comments about<br />\nyour morals, your mother, your<br />\nclothing, religion, and/or<br />\nlifestyle. It means being willing<br />\nto deflect attention and abuse<br />\nso that someone can safely<br />\nenter the clinic.

In response to the rising violence, two state-wide<br />\ncoalitions have formed: the<br />\nCoalition for Choice and the<br />\nCoalition Against Violence to<br />\nThe<br />\nFacilities.<br />\nHealth<br />\nis<br />\nAlliance<br />\nRights<br />\nReproductive<br />\nan active member of each, and<br />\nthrough the Coalition Against<br />\nViolence to Health Facilities<br />\nwill be coordinating escort services throughout most of the<br />\nstate. The need for escorts has<br />\nrisen as more and more protesters become more active,<br />\nmore aggressive, and more<br />\n<br />\nvocal. The Reproductive Rights<br />\nAlliance will be matching clinics<br />\nwho require escort services with<br />\nindividuals and/or groups who<br />\nare willing to be trained to be<br />\nescorts; and will provide the<br />\ntraining for volunteers free of<br />\ncharge.<br />\nAlthough the Howard Street<br />\nClinic is where the Reproductive Rights Alliance does most<br />\nof its escorting, the RRA<br />\nsometimes will provide escort<br />\nservices for other facilities as<br />\nnecessary. For example, when<br />\nthe anti-choice activists planned a sit-in in Wheaton,<br />\nMaryland, in November of last<br />\nyear, the RRA, as part of the<br />\nCoalition for Choice, was there<br />\nto escort clients in through the<br />\nlarge group of demonstrators,<br />\n49 of whom were arrested.<br />\nThey hope to be able to train<br />\nmore volunteers throughout the<br />\nstate so that local people can<br />\ntake care of their own clinics,<br />\nbut will continue to provide services whenever they can to<br />\nplaces outside their usual<br />\nsphere.

But I don't<br />\nknow too many people who<br />\nwould shell out four and a half<br />\nbucks just to see a documentary, so let it be known\u2014not<br />\nonly is this movie informative,<br />\nit's awe-inspiring. Our generation has always heard, for example, how great Fred Astaire<br />\nwas\u2014now we have a chance to<br />\nsee it and it's simply amazing.<br />\nThe movie also presents Bill<br />\n\"Bojangles\" Robinson, in my<br />\nopinion Astaire's only equal<br />\nand in terms of sheer coordination, incredible. The movie<br />\nshows the dance numbers in<br />\ntheir entirety with a minimum<br />\nof narrative intrusion once the<br />\nnumbers get started and, in<br />\nmost cases, these numbers were<br />\nfilmed from a single camera<br />\nangle (the antithesis of MTV);<br />\nthus, one can fully appreciate<br />\nthe<br />\nchoreography,<br />\ncohesiveness, and sheer<br />\nbrilliance of these dances.<br />\nFurthermore, this movie really is entertaining. It's funny\u2014<br />\nthe early dancers are really<br />\nquite hilarious, the Busby<br />\nBerkely clips are full of surprises, and where else do you<br />\nget a chance to see Sammy<br />\nDavis, Jr., as a dancing five-<br />\n<br />\nyear-old? The movie's one<br />\n\"never<br />\nbefore<br />\nseen\"<br />\nsegment\u2014Ray<br />\nBolger's<br />\nScarecrow dance, cut from the<br />\nWizard of Oz, really belongs<br />\nback in the movie\u2014it's quite<br />\ngood. In fact, the only time this<br />\nmovie is less than enjoyable is<br />\nwhen it looks at modern times,<br />\nalthough luckily this part of the<br />\nfilm is quite brief.

The Jays looked<br />\nlike a new team, as they finally<br />\nturned in a performance worthy<br />\nof their talent. They startled,<br />\nconfused, and ultimately overpowered hapless Swarthmore<br />\nwith an aggessive full- court<br />\nman-to-man press. They opened the game with the press and<br />\nforced their opponents into<br />\nmaking numerous mistakes. In<br />\naddition, the Jays' offense<br />\nfinally got it together, as the entire starting line-up hit double<br />\nfigures.

Sottack was<br />\nespecially impressive, hitting 11<br />\nof 12 from the foul line and ripping down 21 rebounds.

Featuring<br />\ncramped, poorly ventilated<br />\nspace and limited equipment,<br />\nthe room had for years been the<br />\ntarget of abuse from serious<br />\nweightlifters who felt their<br />\nneeds inadequately met.<br />\nHowever, after the intersession renaissance, the room now<br />\nhas the air of an exclusive<br />\nfitness club. \"For the past years<br />\nwe had been mindful of the<br />\nneed for expansion and improvement,\" said Athletic Director Bob Scott. \"When I went to<br />\nthe swimming championships<br />\nat Emory, I saw their facility,<br />\nwhich was excellent. That<br />\nalerted me to our need to do<br />\nsomething. Now ours is also a<br />\nfirst class facility.\"<br />\nThe actual improvements<br />\nmade are numerous. First, the<br />\nwall between the weight room<br />\nand the men's locker room was<br />\nknocked out, opening up extra<br />\nspace almost half the size of the<br />\noriginal room, according to<br />\nScott. \"Due to the construction, we were able to make use<br />\nof the high ceiling in the men's<br />\nlocker room, he said. \"Now<br />\nthere's more space vertically as<br />\nwell, which improves the air circulation in the room.\"<br />\nThe annexed space is now<br />\nfurnished with an expanded<br />\nsystem of free weights. The new<br />\nadditions include a squat bar,<br />\na military bench, and a curl<br />\nbench. Previously free weights<br />\ncould only be used for bench<br />\npress. Also, there are new bars<br />\nwith weights welded on, so the<br />\ninconvenience of signing out<br />\nfreeweights(done to avoid theft<br />\nof collars and weights) is<br />\neliminated. Finally, this week,<br />\na new rubberized floor will be<br />\ninstalled in the area to eliminate<br />\nthe uncomfortable relationship<br />\n<br />\nbetween large heavy objects<br />\nand a concrete floor.<br />\nOther improvements include<br />\nthe renovation of the sickly,<br />\ndamaged Universal machines<br />\nand the addition of extra<br />\nlighting and clocks. Perhaps the<br />\nmost intriguing improvement,<br />\nhowever, is the addition of<br />\nthree new hydraulic HydraFitness machines. Sports<br />\nMedicine director John<br />\nBielawski, who was the chief<br />\nengineer of the entire project,<br />\nplayed an integral part (along<br />\nwith a group of varsity coaches)<br />\nof the decision to buy HydraFitness machines. \"I did extensive research on the subject,\"<br />\nhe noted, \"which included<br />\nreading the literature, talking to<br />\nother schools and institutions,<br />\nsound<br />\nfollowing<br />\nand<br />\nphysiological principles. From<br />\nthese guidelines, I concluded<br />\nthat Hydra-Fitness was the best<br />\nway to go.<br />\n\"Hydra-Fitness is the latest<br />\nand the best in the field of exercise physiology. It includes a<br />\nbroad spectrum of capabilities;<br />\nyou can work on your endurance and tone your body,<br />\nyou can improve power, which<br />\ncomes into play in varsity<br />\nathletics, and you can build<br />\nsheer bulk. Probably the best<br />\nfeature of these machines is that<br />\nthey improve the cardiovascular system, which the<br />\nUniversal does not do.\"<br />\nBielawski claims that many<br />\nDivision I schools use HydraFitness equipment, along with<br />\nother such groups as the United<br />\nStates Navy and the Dallas<br />\nCowboys.<br />\nThe general weight room<br />\nnow has three Hydra-Fitness<br />\nmachines. These inlude a bench<br />\npress-rowing machine for chest<br />\nand back, a butterfly machine<br />\nfor chest and shoulders, and a<br />\nHip AB-AD machine for groin<br />\nand thigh. Hopkins will purchase new machines annually,<br />\naccording to Bielawski.<br />\nThe principle behind these<br />\nmachines is what Bielawski<br />\ndescribes as \"double-positive\"<br />\naction and reciprocal muscle<br />\nwork. For instance, on the<br />\nbench press machine, work is<br />\n<br />\nTHE WEEK IN SPORTS<br />\nSaturday, February 2<br />\nWomen's Fencing<br />\nvs. William Paterson<br />\nMen's Fencing<br />\nvs. Stevens & Haverford<br />\n<br />\n11:00 a.m.(A)<br />\n12:00<br />\n(H)<br />\n<br />\np.m.<br />\n<br />\nMen's and Women's Swimming vs.<br />\nAmerican and King's College<br />\nWrestling vs. King's College<br />\nWomen's Basketball<br />\nvs. Lebanon Valley<br />\nMen's Basketball vs. Widener<br />\n<br />\n5.30 p.m.(H)<br />\n81/0 p.m.(H)<br />\n<br />\nTuesday, February 5<br />\nWomen's Basketball vs.<br />\nWestern Maryland<br />\n<br />\n7.00 p.m.(A)<br />\n<br />\n2.00 p.m.(H)<br />\n3.00 p.m.(A)<br />\n<br />\nWednesday, February 6<br />\nMen's JV Basketball vs. Swarthmore ...6:00 p.m.(H)<br />\nMen's and Women's Swimming vs.<br />\nFranklin & Marshall<br />\n7.00 p.m.(A)<br />\n8.00 p.m.(H)<br />\nMen's Basketball vs. Swarthmore<br />\nThursday, February 7<br />\nWomen's Basketball vs. Gettysburg .... 7:00 p.m.(H)<br />\n<br />\nKurt Budelmann<br />\nThe new general weight room features new free weights, Hydra-Fitness equipment, and a large ceiling.<br />\n<br />\ndone not only going up, but<br />\nalso going down (similar to<br />\nlateral pulls).

Although<br />\nhe, too, had received numerous<br />\nacademic awards and honors<br />\n(among them a Fulbright<br />\nFellowship, two Guggenheim<br />\nFellowships, and a National<br />\nEndowment for the Humanities<br />\nFellowship), he was just as<br />\npleasantly surprised by the<br />\nFrench as Goldthwaite had<br />\nbeen by the Italians.<br />\nPerhaps it seems somewhat<br />\nstrange that someone can still<br />\nbe created either a knight of<br />\nItaly or a chevalier of France,<br />\nbut the concept of knighthood<br />\nand the title of knight have<br />\nbeen kept alive in recent French<br />\nand Italian history. In France,<br />\n.particularly, knighthood has<br />\nbeen prescient in the French national conscience. In 1963,<br />\nPrime Minister De Gaulle<br />\nresponded to what he felt was<br /><br />\na lessening of the stature of the<br />\nLegion of Honor by creating a<br />\nseparate Order of Arts and Letters. He reserved the induction<br />\ninto the Legion of Honor for<br />\nthose select few who were a<br />\nsignificant aid and example to<br />\nthe French nation and people.<br />\nIt is to this Order of Arts and<br />\nLetters that Baldwin, a<br />\nspecialist in medieval French<br />\nhistory, has been inducted. His<br />\npublished works include City<br />\non the Seine: Paris under Louis<br />\nIX, 1226-1270(1975); Masters,<br />\nPrinces, and Merchants: The<br />\nSocial Views of Peter the<br />\nChanter and his Circle (1970);<br />\nThe Scholastic Culture of the<br />\nMiddle Ages(1971); and, to be<br />\npublished this year, The<br />\nGovernment<br />\nof Philip<br />\nAugustus: Foundation of<br />\nFrench Royal Power in the<br />\nMiddle Ages. Last February, he<br />\ndelivered a series of lectures on<br />\nPhilip Augustus at the College<br />\nde France in Paris.<br /><br />\nAmong the many awards in<br />\nthe world of academia, there<br />\nare few which carry the distinction of these two. Certainly<br />\nmost members of the faculty at<br />\nHopkins have vitae brimming<br />\nwith marks of honor and excellence in scholarship. Nevertheless, few indeed are the ones<br />\nwhich hold so many traditional<br />\nassociations. Several other<br />\nsimilar honors which have been<br />\nbestowed on Hopkins faculty<br />\ninclude the Order of Commendatori<br />\nallmerits<br />\ndella<br />\nRepublica, given to Professor<br />\nCharles Singleton in 1958; the<br />\nDante medal(one of only three<br />\never given, the other recipients<br />\nbeing T.S.

However, the fact that he wrote<br />\na letter in response is questionable and does<br />\nnot demonstrate a great deal of forethought.<br />\nYet even this action is pardonable, given the<br /><br />\ncontent of the letter, but the notion that the<br />\nletter was used to threaten the author is<br />\nindefensible.<br />\nBinko claims that the letter was not intended to threaten, though the text would<br />\nsuggest otherwise. Binko indicates that he<br />\nmay take actions \"to limit (the author's)<br />\ncommunications to the outside world\" by<br />\ncancelling the student's computer account.<br />\nSuch implication is childish and<br />\nirresponsible.<br />\nThe Student Council, upon learning of<br />\nthese events, passed a resolution Wednesday<br />\nnight stating that electronic COT respondence<br />\nand student computer files be kept confidential and that the Council considers \"any unnecessary intrusion by computer system officials into the accounts intolerable.\"<br />\nCouncil has the right idea, but the<br />\nrepresentatives advocate far too little. It must<br />\nbe made undeniably clear in the future that<br />\nthe Homewood computer system is not to<br />\nbe used for personal ends by computer officials. A public reprimand of the Director<br />\nshould be issued by the Homewood deans.<br />\nA formal apology to the involved student<br />\nshould be forwarded. Finally, undergraduates should be officially assured of<br />\ntheir right to privacy since it appears that little can be taken for granted at this<br />\ninstitution.<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\naltogether.

Since I've<br />\ned to phase out open parties been here, one frat (almost two)<br /><br />\nFrat Applause<br /><br />\nhas lost its house, while two<br />\nfrats have closed up. The administration seems perfectly<br />\nhappy with this, seeming to say,<br />\n\"Well, they're all animals<br />\nanyway.\" Never mind that the<br />\npresidents of the senior, junior,<br />\nand sophomore classes are frat<br />\nmembers, as are many<br />\nhousemasters. The image that<br />\none sees of frats is still one of<br />\nmale chauvinists wreaking<br />\nhavoc and debauching.<br />\nThe administration depends<br />\nvitally upon frats, and yet it still<br />\nadvocates \"frat bashing.\"<br />\nFrats supplement the social life<br />\nof the school greatly, one frat<br />\nalone having a bigger social<br />\nbudget than the school does.<br />\nMany Hopkins institutions,<br />\nsuch as Spring Fair, depend on<br />\nfrats. The administration saves<br />\nthousands by paying frats,<br />\nrather than outside contractors,<br />\nto provide security, parking,<br />\nand clean-up for the fair. When<br />\nthe administration decides to<br />\nshirk some more responsibility<br />\nby having students act as security on the quads at night, the<br />\nfrats are the first ones they turn<br />\nto for help. Despite all that<br />\nfrats do for the school, the administration still seems bent on<br />\nletting them die out.<br />\nAfter a few years here,<br />\nthough, this sort of stuff<br />\ndoesn't surprise one. After seeing all sorts of social activities<br /><br />\ndie out(Chester's Place and the<br />\nChaplain's Office Spring Concert), the Hut attacked, tuition<br />\nraised about a thousand bucks<br />\na year (from $5700 to $8600<br />\nsince I've been here), and the<br />\nradio station go off the air (it<br />\nwouldn't be on in a few months<br />\nif the license weren't threatened), it wouldn't be too shocking to see Hopkins go fratless<br />\ntoo.<br />\nIt's disturbing sometimes<br />\nthat people don't get too mad<br />\nabout these sort of happenings.<br />\nThe University comes up with<br />\na farcical security proposal,<br />\nwanting now to use work-study<br />\npeople as quad monitors in a city with the second highest crime<br />\nrate in the nation, and people<br />\ndon't complain.

He was<br />\nrecently reelected by a vast<br />\nmargin and enjoys a long-term<br />\napproval rating unmatched by<br />\nany recent president. Yet, much<br />\nof his popularity is personal,<br />\nnot based on his political positions. These positions individually and collectively make<br />\none wonder about his<br />\npossibilities for success on the<br />\nissues during the second term.<br />\nLet's begin with the balanced budget amendment. Reagan<br />\nhas continually supported such<br />\nan amendment, but he has<br />\nnever submitted a budget to<br />\nCongress with less than a $150<br />\nbillion dollar deficit. As a matter of fact, deficits have doubled under Reagan. Thus,<br />\nReagan's advocacy of a balanced budget amendment can only be seen as wishful thinking.<br />\nReagan has also consistently<br />\nendorsed a military buildup for<br />\na \"strong\" defense. Therefore,<br />\nthe military budget has increased dramatically since Reagan<br />\ntook office. Few would\u2022 argue<br />\nwith Reagan's motives or intentions, but the buildup's scope<br />\nand relative size have been<br />\nquestioned. Does it make sense<br />\nto spend $30 billion on the MX<br />\nmissile, when Congress and the<br />\nmilitary entertain very serious<br />\nand substantial doubts about<br />\nthe vulnerability of the missile?<br />\nThe President defends the<br />\nsystem as a \"bargaining chip\"<br />\nand wishes to see it continued<br />\nbecause cancellation of the program would send the wrong<br />\n\"signals\" to Moscow about<br />\nU.S. \"toughness.\" Is such a<br />\ndubious explanation worth $30<br />\nbillion? Other reasons have<br />\nbeen forwarded, but none by<br />\nthe President himself. Congress<br />\ndisagrees with the President on<br />\nthis issue. Even Senator Barry<br />\nGoldwater of Arizona, a<br />\nhawkish conservative, has<br />\nstated that the MX has little<br />\nchance of passing (Time,<br />\n1-28-85, p. 22). Reagan,<br />\nhowever, still counts the MX as<br />\nan important part of his overall<br /><br />\nmilitary program.<br />\nDefense spending is also tied<br />\nin with the deficit. The high rate<br />\nof spending is a major factor in<br />\nthe deficit's increase. Reagan<br />\nhas accepted as gospel the insignificant reductions in the<br />\nmilitary budget proposed by<br />\nCaspar Weinberger. Reagan<br />\nseems to feel that this savings is<br />\nmore than enough. No<br />\nweapons system was touched,<br />\nnor was military pay. Yet,<br />\nReagan has imposed a reduction of 5% on federal<br />\nemployees' salaries and is omitting the usual COLA increase.<br />\nIf Reagan feels that this is<br />\nnecessary to reduce the deficit,<br />\nhow can the military budget be<br />\nleft essentially untouched when<br />\nso many other programs like<br />\nfunds for education and health<br />\ncare are being slashed to the<br />\nbone. Even though the military<br />\nis well known for procurement<br />\ninefficiency ($4000 dollar coffeemakers)and waste as well as<br />\nweapons that are too delicate or<br />\ncomplicated. This question has<br />\nbeen left generally unanswered<br />\nby Reagan. Other Republicans,<br />\nhowever, say that the military<br />\nwill have to shoulder a larger<br />\npart of the deficit reduction or<br />\nthe new budget will not pass<br />\neither the Senate or the House.<br />\nThus, another of Reagan's platforms is in trouble.<br />\nThe President, in a recent<br />\nradio interview, stated that<br />\nblacks voted against him<br />\nbecause they misunderstood his<br />\npolicies and exactly how much<br />\nhe has done for them. One of<br />\nthe statistics he used was that of<br />\nthe six million people who<br />\nfound jobs in the last four<br />\nyears, one million of them were<br />\nblack (New York Times,<br />\n1-27-85, p. Al2). Another<br />\nstatistic used in the interview is<br />\nthe fact that black unemployment is 2\u00bd times white<br />\nunemployment. Blacks make<br />\nup nearly thirty percent of the<br />\ntotal unemployed, yet they<br />\nreceive only sixteen percent of<br />\nthe new jobs. Thus, black<br />\nunemployment vis-a-vis whites<br />\nis becoming worse, not better as<br />\nthe President implies. During<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n'Dear Mr. President: Now that you've spent so much on defense<br />\nto protect our way of life, maybe you could do something to make<br />\nour way of life worth protecting. .<br />\nthe presidential campaign,<br />\nWalter Mondale could not convince the public that Reagan is<br />\nnot fair. In my opinion, the<br />\nblacks' voting record in 1984<br />\nwas not because of misrepresentation or as a sign of<br />\nmisunderstanding, but as a<br />\nrealization of their own interests. Reagan has historic<br />\npopularity, yet he has alienated<br />\na large minority of Americans<br />\nand his prospect of being<br />\nremembered as a \"great\" president is distinctly dimmer<br />\nbecause of that fact.<br /><br />\nby Howard Bregman<br />\nThe Student Council is seeking increased communication<br />\nbetween<br />\nitself<br />\nand<br />\nundergraduates, and I say<br />\n\"bravo,\" but expect little.

In The Fallacy of Star<br />\nWars, the Union of Concerned<br />\nScientists delivers an interesting, straight-to-the-point<br />\nand easy to read analysis of the<br />\nSDI, otherwise known as \"Star<br />\nWars.\" The topic is attacked<br />\nfrom all angles, offering convincing evidence for the scientist, the economist, and the<br />\npolitician.<br /><br />\nThe book is neatly divided<br />\ninto three parts. The first is an<br />\nintroduction which gives a brief<br />\nreview of the history of nuclear<br />\nweapons and the arms race. Included in this section are summaries of the Anti-Ballistic<br />\nMissile (ABM) and Strategic<br />\nArms Limitation Treaties<br />\n(SALT) and their effects.<br />\nThe second and third sections<br />\nare the real meat of the book.<br />\nPart two provides an in-depth<br />\nlook at spaced-based missile<br />\ndefense systems, such as those<br />\ncurrently being investigated by<br />\nthe Department of Defense.<br />\nThese include X-ray lasers,<br />\nchemical lasers, orbiting battle<br />\nstations, and pop-up interception devices. Each one of these<br />\nsystems is analyzed as to how<br /><br />\nExcerpt<br />\n.The election of Ronald<br />\nReagan in 1980 brought to<br />\npower a group ideologically<br />\nhostile to arms control, convinced of Soviet bad faith,<br />\nand committed to a major<br />\nU.S. nuclear builup to<br />\nreverse what it saw as a trend<br />\ntoward Soviet superiority.<br />\nThe arms control talks of the<br />\n1970s, in the view of the new<br />\nadministration, had lulled<br />\nthe United States into what<br />\namounted to unilateral<br />\ndisarmament while the<br />\nSoviet Union relentlessly<br />\nforged ahead with a military<br />\nbuildup. This was a highly<br />\nskewed version of recent<br />\nhistory, in view of the huge<br />\nU.S. warhead buildup during the 1970s, which was ac-<br /><br />\ntually larger than the<br />\nSoviets', but it was politically potent. The barrage of accusations against the arms<br />\ncontrol process inevitably<br />\nexposed the ABM Treaty\u2014<br />\nthe most visable symbol of<br />\nthat process\u2014to a formidable attack. There were<br />\nearly hints from the new administration, reinforced by<br />\nthe prominence it gave to the<br />\nso-called<br />\nwindow<br />\nof<br />\nvulnerability facing U.S.<br />\nland-based missiles, that<br />\nABM deployment would<br />\nreceive serious consideration. In a clear departure<br />\nfrom its predecessors, the<br />\nReagan White House did not<br />\ntreat the 1972 treaty as<br />\nsacrosanct.\"<br /><br />\nthey operate and how they<br />\nwould have to be deployed to<br />\nbe effective. There are two<br />\nchapters in this section which<br />\ndeal with the technological<br />\naspects of the weapons. These<br />\nmay be hard for some people to<br />\nfollow. The authors even suggest that readers less interested<br />\nin the scientific details can skip<br />\nover those chapters. They really are not that hard to follow<br />\nand probably anyone with a<br />\nhigh school background in<br />\nphysics should have no problem<br />\ngetting through those chapters.<br />\nHowever, they can be passed<br />\nover without really detracting<br />\nfrom the major points of the<br />\nbook.<br />\nIn order to build or evaluate<br />\na defense system, one must<br />\nknow the offense very well. For<br />\nthis reason the authors include<br />\na detailed description of the<br />\nmechanisms and vulnerabilities<br />\nof Inter-Continental Ballistic<br />\nMissiles(ICBMs). This is essential to understanding the<br />\ncapabilities and shortcomings<br />\nof the defense systems<br />\ndiscussed.<br />\nOne interesting chapter is entitled \"Physics and Geometry<br />\nversus Secrecy and Clairvoyance.\" This short section<br />\nexplains how the scientists can<br />\neffectively appraise the spacebased missile defense systems<br />\nusing only scientific laws and<br />\nfacts, with no access to<br />\nclassified military information.<br />\nThe most informative part of<br />\nthe second section is where the<br />\nauthors propose countermeasures which the Soviets<br />\nwould probably use to undermine any of the defense<br />\nsystems. The striking thing here<br /><br />\njot ok-\\<br /><br />\nthktilik)<br /><br />\n#<br /><br />\nWhy SpaceWeapons Can't<br />\nProtect Us<br /><br />\nis that each of these highly effective countermeasures are<br />\nrelatively cheap and easy to<br />\ndeploy using present-day<br />\ntechnology. On the other hand,<br />\nthe \"Star Wars\" systems are all<br />\nastronomically expensive and<br />\ndepend on major break -<br /><br />\nthroughs in science and<br />\ntechnology that have yet to occur.

McDarrah; William Morrow and Company; 338 pages,<br />\n$17.95.<br />\nYou'll have to excuse me if<br />\nI'm a bit overenthusiastic about<br />\nthis book. Y'see, there are a lot<br />\nof sixties rejects around this<br />\ncampus. I'm one of the few<br />\nwho considers himself lucky to<br />\nbe a beat reject. This book,<br />\ntherefore, is a godsend.<br />\nThe editor of Kerouac and<br />\nFriends, Fred W. McDarrah,<br />\nused to be a photographer for<br />\nthe Village Voice. He lived in<br />\nGreenwich<br />\nVillage, the<br />\nresidence of the Beats, during<br />\ntheir short-lived New York heyday. His<br />\nphotographic<br />\nbackground helps his book. Interspersed between Mr. McDarrah's photographs are short<br />\nessays from the period. They<br />\nrange from the loving analyses<br />\nof the Beatnik journalists to the<br />\ndamning views of the<br />\n\"establishment,\" and therein<br /><br />\nExcerpt<br />\n\"...The origins of the word<br />\n'beat' are obscure, but the<br />\nmeaning is only too clear to<br />\nmost Americans. More than<br />\nmere weariness, it implies<br />\nthe feeling of having been<br />\nused, of being raw. It involves a sort of nakedness of<br />\nmind, and, ultimately, of<br />\nsoul; a feeling of being<br />\nreduced to the bedrock of<br />\nconsciousness. In short, it<br />\nmeans being undramatically<br />\npushed up against the wall of<br />\noneself. A man is beat<br />\nwhenever he goes for broke<br />\nand wagers the sum of his<br />\nresources on a single<br />\nnumber; and the young<br />\ngeneration has done that<br />\ncontinually from early<br />\nyouth.\"<br />\nlies the key to his work.<br />\nThis book could have been a<br />\nnostalgic and loving look back<br />\nby a Beatnik for Beatniks. Instead, McDarrah makes sure<br />\nthat the bad views of the Beat-<br /><br />\nniks aren't the maniacal views<br />\nthat people usually have for rejects. Thus, we get the kind of<br />\nview that treats the Beats not as<br />\na hula-hoop type fad, but as an<br />\nimportant movement that set<br />\nthe stage for the social and<br />\npolitical changes of the sixties.<br />\nAs David McReynolds wrote:<br />\n\". . .[The beat generation by<br />\nits very existence serves notice<br />\non all of us who are political<br />\nthat if we want to involve youth<br />\nin politics we must develop a<br />\npolitics of action. The beat<br />\ngeneration can understand<br />\nGhandi much better than they<br />\ncan understand Roosevelt. They<br />\ncan understand Martin Luther<br />\nKing much better than they can<br />\nunderstand that Hubert Humphrey.\"<br />\nOnce you read this article,<br />\nyou understand that these<br />\npolitics of #. lion evolved into<br />\nthe radicalism of the Sixties.<br />\nThus, we must remember and<br />\nlearn from the Beatniks.<br />\nContinued on Page 11<br /><br />\n10/FEBRUARY 1, 1985<br /><br />\nCOLLEGE WEEKS<br />\n0e<br />\n0%<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\ne<br />\n0 The M.

Dr.<br />\nAllan Drash, head of the<br />\nDepartment of Endocrinology<br />\nat Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, was one of the participants. Drash is the immediate past president of the<br />\nAmerican Diabetes Association, and one of the world's<br />\nleading experts .in the field of<br /><br />\nas a result of the disorder.<br />\nElimination of these complications is the basis of the many<br />\nresearch efforts going on<br />\naround the world. Since virtually all victims of diabetes under<br />\nthe age of 20 are insulindependent, much research is<br />\ndirected at these young people,<br />\nwho stand the greatest chance<br />\ndeveloping<br />\nfuture<br />\nof<br />\ncomplications.<br />\nCAUSE<br />\nThe first 'C' is cause, or<br />\netiology of diabetes. Research<br /><br />\nAmerican Diabetes Association<br /><br />\nDr. Allan Drash of the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.<br /><br />\nchildhood diabetes.<br />\nDrash summarizes the many<br />\ndifferent aspects of diabetes<br />\nresearch in terms of the \"five<br />\nC's\": cause, course, care, complications, and cure. These five<br />\nheadings encompass most of<br />\nthe current issues involving the<br />\ndisorder.<br />\nDiabetes mellitus results<br />\nwhen the beta cells of the pancreas slow down or stop producing insulin, the hormone<br />\nwhich allows the body to<br />\nmetabolize carbohydrates.<br />\nThe milder form of the<br />\ndisorder, known as Type II<br />\ndiabetes, is thought to occur<br />\nwhen the patient's body cells<br />\nare resistant to the insulin produced by the pancreas, or when<br />\nthe pancreas itself produces a<br />\nlow amount of insulin. Found<br />\nmostly in older adults, its control can usually be achieved by<br />\npills or diet alone.<br />\nIn insulin-dependent diabetes<br />\nmellitus(IDDM), however, the<br />\npancreas completely stops producing the hormone and the patient must rely on daily injections of insulin to stay alive.<br />\nAlthough these injections do<br />\nkeep the patient alive, in no<br />\nway can they be considered a<br />\ncure. Diabetics often experience<br />\nhigher than normal levels of<br />\nblood sugar. They are also subject to spells of low blood sugar<br />\nknown as insulin reactions,<br />\nwhich can cause brain damage<br />\nor death if not treated with<br />\nsugar immediately.<br />\nMany long-term complications, such as kidney damage,<br />\natherosclerosis, eye damage,<br />\nand neuropathy can also occur<br /><br />\nis particularly aimed at determining the factors involved in<br />\nbeta cell damage. Although little is known for sure, it is<br />\ngenerally, believed that genetic<br />\npredisposition, viral infections,<br />\nand autoimmune destruction of<br />\nbeta cells interact with environmental factors to cause<br />\ndiabetes.<br />\nOne interesting finding is<br />\nthat a certain gene involved in<br />\nthe immune system, the HLADR, is of two particular types<br />\nin diabetics. Almost all IDDM<br />\npatients possess either HLADR 3, HLA-DR 4, or both.<br />\nThis would obviously suggest<br />\ngenetic predisposition to the<br />\ndisorder. Furthermore, it seems<br />\nthat the two types of genes<br />\nthemselves differ in the<br />\nunderlying etiology and clinical<br />\ncourse of the patient's diabetes.<br />\nWhile HLA-DR 3 is associated<br />\nwith a chronic, ongoing,<br />\nautoimmune process, HLA-DR<br />\n4 patients are more likely to<br />\ndevelop diabetes by an acute infectious process. This provides<br />\nevidence<br />\nthat<br />\ngenetic<br />\npredisposition may interact<br />\nwith autoimmune, viral, or environmental factors in the<br />\ndestruction of beta cells.<br />\nMany specific viruses have<br />\nbeen implicated in relation to<br />\ndiabetes, including the coxsackie group, mumps, rubella,<br />\ninfluenza, and hepatitis. In<br />\n1973, during an epidemic of<br />\nReye's Syndrome which occurred across the northeastern.<br />\nUnited States, five out of twenty afflicted children who died at<br />\nChildren's Hospital in Pittsburgh also presented symptoms<br />\nof diabetes mellitus. It was later<br />\ndiscovered that the primary initiating virus for Reye's Syndrome was Influenza B, thus<br />\nsuggesting a link between this<br />\nvirus and diabetes.<br /><br />\nEnvironmental factors are<br />\nalso implicated in the causation<br />\nof diabetes. Certain pollutants<br />\nand toxins have been shown to<br />\ncause the disorder in laboratory<br />\nanimals. Several individuals<br />\nbecame diabetic after attempting suicide by ingesting vacor,<br />\na type of rat poison. Some<br />\nnitrosamines in food have also<br />\nbeen implicated in beta-cell<br />\ndamage.<br />\nAnother interesting finding is<br />\nthe enormous variation in expression of IDDM around the<br />\nworld. The highest attack rate<br />\nis in Finland, where 40 cases occur for every 100,000 children<br />\neach year. In Pittsburgh, the<br />\nrate is 15 per 100,000, while in<br />\nJapan, less than 1 case per<br />\n100,000 occurs each year. These<br />\ndifferences can't be explained<br />\nby genetic factors alone; the<br />\nprimary explanation must lie in<br />\nthe environment.<br />\nOne difference in the various<br />\ncountries is in the mode of<br />\nnutrition. Animal studies have<br />\nshown that dietary manipulation has a large impact on the<br />\nexpression of diabetes. A study<br />\nin Copenhagen found that<br />\nbreast-feeding may have a protective mechanism against<br />\ndiabetes, or that absence of<br />\nbreast-feeding may lead to increased susceptibility in individuals who already have the<br />\nunderlying defect. Evidence for<br />\nthis includes the fact that the<br />\nfrequency of IDDM increases<br />\nthe further a population is from<br />\nthe equator. This corresponds<br />\nto the increase in industrialized<br />\nareas, which, in turn, means a<br />\ndecrease in the tendency of<br />\nmothers in a population to<br />\nbreast-feed. In Samoa, where<br />\nthere are no cows, all children<br />\nare breast-fed. There are no<br /><br />\nIDDM victims in Samoa. When<br />\nSamoans move to another<br />\ncountry, however, future<br />\ngenerations begin to develop<br />\ndiabetes at a rate equivalent to<br />\nthe rate in that country.<br /><br />\nHighlights<br /><br />\n(Premiere!!!); 8:00p.m.:<br />\nNature\u2014Birds of Paradox.<br /><br />\nPublic TV\u2014Science and<br />\nNature Programs<br /><br />\nMon., Feb. 4, 7:30p.m.:<br />\nWild, Wild World of<br />\nAnimals\u2014What the Dolphin<br />\nKnows.<br /><br />\nChannel 67, Baltimore<br />\nFri.,<br />\nFeb.<br />\n1,<br />\n7:30p.m.:Wild, Wild World<br />\nof Animals\u2014The Floating<br />\nWilderness.<br />\nSat., Feb. 2, 8:30a.m.:<br />\nOceanus\u2014The Water Planet,<br />\nCosmic Origins; 1:30p.m.:<br />\nNew Tech Times; 2:00p.m.:<br />\nThe Nature of Things II;<br />\n3:00p.m.: Nova (R)\u2014The<br />\nConquest of the Parasites;<br />\n4:30p.m.: Academy on<br />\nComputers\u2014What Next ?;<br />\n8:00p.m.: The Undersea<br />\nWorld<br />\nof<br />\nJacques<br />\nCousteau\u2014Sharks; 9:00p.m.:<br />\nNature(R)\u2014Flight of the<br />\nBumblebee.<br />\nSun., Feb. 3, 9:30a.m.:<br />\nAcademy on Computers(R);<br />\n10:00a.m.: The New Literacy:<br />\nAn<br />\nIntroduction<br />\nto<br />\nComputers\u2014The Computing<br />\nMachine, Part II, Communicating with a Computer;<br />\n7:00p.m.: The Living Planet:<br />\nA Portrait of the Earth\u2014The<br />\nBuilding of the Earth<br /><br />\nCOURSE<br />\nMany studies are currently<br />\naimed at determining what happens to the diabetic over time.<br />\nOne current focus is the honeymoon or remission of the<br />\ndisease.

Advances in<br />\nrecent years have made care<br />\nsomewhat easier. One is home<br />\nblood glucose monitoring, in<br />\nwhich patients test their own<br />\nblood for sugar. Another is extra long-acting insulin, which<br />\nallows more flexibility in eating<br />\nregimens.<br />\nA recent development which<br />\nhas contributed significantly to<br />\npatients' awareness of how well<br />\nthey are controlling their own<br />\nblood sugar levels, is the<br />\nmeasurement of glycosylated<br />\nhemoglobin A(1c)levels. These<br />\nmolecules are variants of the<br />\nhemoglobin molecule, and occur in elevated levels in<br />\ndiabetics. It was found that the<br />\nlevel of hemoglobin A(1c) in<br />\nthe blood corresponds to the<br />\naverage blood glucose levels<br />\nover approximately a fourmonth period.

The Trident I and<br />\nTrident II missiles \"are as different as a lightning-bug and<br />\nlightning.\" Both are submarine<br />\nlaunched ballistic missiles<br />\n.(SLBM), and have a range of<br />\nbetween 4000 a-r-Icl 6300 nautical<br />\nmiles. Lockheed is the primary<br />\ncontractor for both.<br />\nThe most significant difference is in accuracy. The Trident I had an accuracy of approximately 500 meters, sufficient for retaliatory strikes<br />\nagainst almost any economic<br />\ntarget (including cities, factories, etc.), but useless against<br />\nany hardened missile silos. The<br />\nTrident II has an accuracy of<br />\napproximately 150 meters,<br />\nwhich is sufficient to destroy<br />\nhardened missile silos.<br />\nThe payload is different. The<br />\nTrident I carries eight<br />\n100-kiloton warheads (the<br />\nbombs dropped on Hiroshima<br />\nand Nagasaki were about 12<br />\nkilotons), the Trident II carries<br />\neither 14 100-kiloton warheads,<br />\nor 9 33-kiloton warheads<br />\n(which are necessary to destroy<br />\n\"hard\" targets, such as missiles<br />\nin their silos).<br />\nThomas J. Downey,<br />\nDemocratic Congressman from<br />\nNew York, says that the Trident II is destabilizing because<br />\nit \"increases the probability of<br /><br />\nstrategic nuclear war by<br />\nthreatening to prevent the other<br />\nside from retaliating. Thus, it<br />\ngives the owner the incentive to<br />\nuse it in a crisis, and leaves its<br />\nintended victim no option but<br />\nto beat it to the punch.\"<br />\nThe destabilizing effect of<br />\nTrident II is compounded by<br />\nthe fact that it is submarinelaunched. They position<br />\nthemselves just off Soviet<br />\nshores, reducing the flight time,<br />\nnecessitating what is called<br />\n\"launch-in-warning\" on the<br />\nSoviets' part. In other words,<br />\nthe decision to launch their<br />\nweapons must be made in<br />\nunder 15 minutes. This means<br />\nthat if the Soviets do not want<br />\ntheir missiles and bombers<br />\ndestroyed on the ground, they<br /><br />\n\"It is true that the<br />\nAPL is involred in the<br />\ndevelopment of Trident and cruise<br />\nmissiles, but that is only in the area of<br />\nresearch<br />\nand<br />\ndevelopment.\"<br />\n-Carl 0.

Although this may encompass a wide range of activities, the Reproductive<br />\nRights Alliance focuses mainly<br />\non client escorting.<br />\nAfter last year's 11th anniversary of the Roe versus<br />\nWade Supreme Court decision<br />\nwhich legalized abortion, during which anti-choice protests<br />\nreceived a large amount of<br />\nmedia coverage, members of<br />\nthe Reproductive Rights<br />\nAlliance approached the<br />\nclinic's<br />\nStreet<br />\nHoward<br />\nVolunteer Coordinator to offer<br />\ntheir services. The clinic gets<br />\npicketed every Saturday morning, and demonstrators were<br />\nbeginning to get more aggressive towards patients, so<br />\nPlanned Parenthood accepted<br />\nthe offer of escorts.<br />\nSince then, the Reproductive<br />\nRights Alliance has grown in<br />\nnumbers and in strength. Every<br />\nSaturday morning between five<br />\nand ten people pull themselves<br />\nout of bed at 7:00 a.m. and go<br /><br />\ndown to Howard Street,<br />\nweather,<br />\nof<br />\nregardless<br />\ntemperature, or hangovers.<br />\nAnother half-dozen are \"oncall\" in case reinforcements are<br />\nneeded for an unexpected<br />\ndemonstration or above<br />\naverage levels of harassment.<br />\nOnce they arrive at the clinic,<br />\nthey meet with the staff coordinator to receive their escort<br />\nsigns and identification badges,<br />\nand any special information<br />\nthey may need to know that<br />\nday. Their primary responsibility is to insure that those women<br />\nand men who have legitimate<br />\nreason are able to enter the<br />\nclinic, and to make sure that<br />\nthose efforts do not escalate the<br />\nlevel of protester activity.<br />\nThe protesters arrive around<br />\n8:00 a.m. Anywhere from 5 or<br />\n6 to as many as 50 protesters<br />\nwill begin walking up and down<br />\non the sidewalk. By order of the<br />\nBaltimore City Police Department, they must keep moving;<br />\nalthough this rule is rarely<br />\nfollowed strictly, most do walk<br />\nabout.<br />\nSome of the protesters content themselves to actual<br />\npicketing: carrying signs and<br />\nthe like. Others pass out<br />\nliterature and do \"sidewalk<br />\n\"Sidewalk<br />\ncounseling.\"<br />\ncounseling\" usually means accosting a patient halfway down<br /><br />\nthe sidewalk, shoving some<br />\ngory pictures into their face,<br />\nasking them repeatedly whether<br />\nor not they are going to have an<br />\nabortion, and, if they continue<br />\nto ignore the protester, screaming after their receding figure in.<br />\nthe doorway, \"Murderer!<br />\nMurderer!\"<br />\nThe job of the escort is to<br />\nhelp clients enter the building<br />\nwith a minimum of emotional<br />\nassault, providing a distraction<br />\nfor the attentions of the protesters; and doing anything<br />\npossible to make the whole<br />\nscene easier for the clients. This<br />\nentails stating clearly to the patients \"I am with the clinic. I'll<br />\nescort you into the clinic if you<br />\nlike\" so that clients do not confuse who is who on the<br />\nsidewalk. It entails keeping<br />\none's temper, even when protesters harass you; it means not<br />\nresponding to comments about<br />\nyour morals, your mother, your<br />\nclothing, religion, and/or<br />\nlifestyle. It means being willing<br />\nto deflect attention and abuse<br />\nso that someone can safely<br />\nenter the clinic.

In response to the rising violence, two state-wide<br />\ncoalitions have formed: the<br />\nCoalition for Choice and the<br />\nCoalition Against Violence to<br />\nThe<br />\nFacilities.<br />\nHealth<br />\nis<br />\nAlliance<br />\nRights<br />\nReproductive<br />\nan active member of each, and<br />\nthrough the Coalition Against<br />\nViolence to Health Facilities<br />\nwill be coordinating escort services throughout most of the<br />\nstate.

Sottack's play is one of five student plays chosen by Edward Albee to be performed this<br />\nweekend. Friday night, head Over Heels, written by Rich Harkaway and directed by Sybil Cook; Mrs.<br />\nGramophone; and Physicians, written by Bruce Cohen and directed by Ted Wrigley will be presented. The<br />\nfollowing night, the remaining two, Mate in Two, written by Andy Piacsek and directed by Albee; and Violins,<br />\nViolence, written by Pat Capuano and directed by Bruce Cohen, will be presented. All five plays will be performed on Sunday.

But I don't<br />\nknow too many people who<br />\nwould shell out four and a half<br />\nbucks just to see a documentary, so let it be known\u2014not<br />\nonly is this movie informative,<br />\nit's awe-inspiring. Our generation has always heard, for example, how great Fred Astaire<br />\nwas\u2014now we have a chance to<br />\nsee it and it's simply amazing.<br />\nThe movie also presents Bill<br />\n\"Bojangles\" Robinson, in my<br />\nopinion Astaire's only equal<br />\nand in terms of sheer coordination, incredible. The movie<br />\nshows the dance numbers in<br />\ntheir entirety with a minimum<br />\nof narrative intrusion once the<br />\nnumbers get started and, in<br />\nmost cases, these numbers were<br />\nfilmed from a single camera<br />\nangle (the antithesis of MTV);<br />\nthus, one can fully appreciate<br />\nthe<br />\nchoreography,<br />\ncohesiveness, and sheer<br />\nbrilliance of these dances.<br />\nFurthermore, this movie really is entertaining. It's funny\u2014<br />\nthe early dancers are really<br />\nquite hilarious, the Busby<br />\nBerkely clips are full of surprises, and where else do you<br />\nget a chance to see Sammy<br />\nDavis, Jr., as a dancing five-<br /><br />\nyear-old? The movie's one<br />\n\"never<br />\nbefore<br />\nseen\"<br />\nsegment\u2014Ray<br />\nBolger's<br />\nScarecrow dance, cut from the<br />\nWizard of Oz, really belongs<br />\nback in the movie\u2014it's quite<br />\ngood. In fact, the only time this<br />\nmovie is less than enjoyable is<br />\nwhen it looks at modern times,<br />\nalthough luckily this part of the<br />\nfilm is quite brief. John<br />\nTravolta just doesn't belong in<br />\nthe ranks of the great movie<br />\ndancers and while Michael<br />\nJackson's Beat It video is effective as a whole, they choose only to show the very end of the<br />\nvideo, which is really quite<br />\nunremarkable.<br />\nBut it's not only in the dancing that the older numbers are<br />\nsuperior to the newer ones\u2014it's<br />\nin the way these movies<br />\nthemselves were made. The<br />\nmusical makers of the fifties,<br />\nfor example, really knew how<br />\nto use Technicolor\u2014the colors<br />\nare spectacular\u2014especially on<br />\nthe big screen (this is harder to<br />\nnotice on TV). Furthermore,<br />\nthe music behind the dance<br />\nnumbers is clearly superior\u2014<br />\nyou can't beat Cole Porter's<br />\n\"Night and Day\"(danced to by<br />\nAstaire and Rogers in The Gay<br />\nDivorcee)for true musicality.

Be<br /><br />\n22/FEBRUARY 1, 198<br /><br />\n\"First Class\" Weight Room Opens For General Use<br />\nby John Galotto<br />\nThe Hopkins athletic department culminated a year of<br />\ndiligent research over intersession with the drastic improvement of the general fitness<br />\nweight room.<br />\nThe general weight room<br />\n(not to be confused with the<br />\nvarsity weight room) had<br />\npreviously been a sore spot of<br />\nthe Athletic Center. Featuring<br />\ncramped, poorly ventilated<br />\nspace and limited equipment,<br />\nthe room had for years been the<br />\ntarget of abuse from serious<br />\nweightlifters who felt their<br />\nneeds inadequately met.<br />\nHowever, after the intersession renaissance, the room now<br />\nhas the air of an exclusive<br />\nfitness club. \"For the past years<br />\nwe had been mindful of the<br />\nneed for expansion and improvement,\" said Athletic Director Bob Scott. \"When I went to<br />\nthe swimming championships<br />\nat Emory, I saw their facility,<br />\nwhich was excellent. That<br />\nalerted me to our need to do<br />\nsomething. Now ours is also a<br />\nfirst class facility.\"<br />\nThe actual improvements<br />\nmade are numerous. First, the<br />\nwall between the weight room<br />\nand the men's locker room was<br />\nknocked out, opening up extra<br />\nspace almost half the size of the<br />\noriginal room, according to<br />\nScott. \"Due to the construction, we were able to make use<br />\nof the high ceiling in the men's<br />\nlocker room, he said. \"Now<br />\nthere's more space vertically as<br />\nwell, which improves the air circulation in the room.\"<br />\nThe annexed space is now<br />\nfurnished with an expanded<br />\nsystem of free weights. The new<br />\nadditions include a squat bar,<br />\na military bench, and a curl<br />\nbench. Previously free weights<br />\ncould only be used for bench<br />\npress. Also, there are new bars<br />\nwith weights welded on, so the<br />\ninconvenience of signing out<br />\nfreeweights(done to avoid theft<br />\nof collars and weights) is<br />\neliminated. Finally, this week,<br />\na new rubberized floor will be<br />\ninstalled in the area to eliminate<br />\nthe uncomfortable relationship<br /><br />\nbetween large heavy objects<br />\nand a concrete floor.<br />\nOther improvements include<br />\nthe renovation of the sickly,<br />\ndamaged Universal machines<br />\nand the addition of extra<br />\nlighting and clocks. Perhaps the<br />\nmost intriguing improvement,<br />\nhowever, is the addition of<br />\nthree new hydraulic HydraFitness machines. Sports<br />\nMedicine director John<br />\nBielawski, who was the chief<br />\nengineer of the entire project,<br />\nplayed an integral part (along<br />\nwith a group of varsity coaches)<br />\nof the decision to buy HydraFitness machines. \"I did extensive research on the subject,\"<br />\nhe noted, \"which included<br />\nreading the literature, talking to<br />\nother schools and institutions,<br />\nsound<br />\nfollowing<br />\nand<br />\nphysiological principles. From<br />\nthese guidelines, I concluded<br />\nthat Hydra-Fitness was the best<br />\nway to go.<br />\n\"Hydra-Fitness is the latest<br />\nand the best in the field of exercise physiology. It includes a<br />\nbroad spectrum of capabilities;<br />\nyou can work on your endurance and tone your body,<br />\nyou can improve power, which<br />\ncomes into play in varsity<br />\nathletics, and you can build<br />\nsheer bulk. Probably the best<br />\nfeature of these machines is that<br />\nthey improve the cardiovascular system, which the<br />\nUniversal does not do.\"<br />\nBielawski claims that many<br />\nDivision I schools use HydraFitness equipment, along with<br />\nother such groups as the United<br />\nStates Navy and the Dallas<br />\nCowboys.<br />\nThe general weight room<br />\nnow has three Hydra-Fitness<br />\nmachines. These inlude a bench<br />\npress-rowing machine for chest<br />\nand back, a butterfly machine<br />\nfor chest and shoulders, and a<br />\nHip AB-AD machine for groin<br />\nand thigh. Hopkins will purchase new machines annually,<br />\naccording to Bielawski.<br />\nThe principle behind these<br />\nmachines is what Bielawski<br />\ndescribes as \"double-positive\"<br />\naction and reciprocal muscle<br />\nwork.

It was a lead which would<br />\nnever diminish.<br />\nThe Lady Jays kept the game<br />\nclose, though, with a persistent<br />\ndefense. Problems, however,<br />\naccompanied<br />\ntheir<br />\naggressiveness as senior cocaptain Dawn Richards<br />\ngathered her third foul with<br />\nover four minutes left in the<br />\nhalf. Without her play,<br />\nHopkins was unable to control<br />\nthe boards and headed into the<br />\nlocker room down by six<br />\npoints, 26-32.<br />\nAs with many games this<br />\nseason, the Jays' poor foul<br />\nshooting was a big hindrance:<br />\nHopkins sank only four of ten<br />\nattempts in the half while the<br />\nRed Devils converted eight of<br />\neleven.<br />\nThe hoopsters came out<br />\nstrong in the second half and<br />\nclosed the margin to three as<br />\nfreshman Cindy Harper put in<br />\na lay-up while being fouled. She<br />\nmissed the opportunity to convert the free throw, however,<br />\nand Dickinson was able to score<br />\nsix unanswered points in the<br />\nnext two minutes to seemingly<br />\ntake command with the score<br />\n44-35.<br />\nAs the game wore on, Harper<br />\nand Richards were better able<br />\nto run the fast break, with<br />\nRichards pulling down the rebounds (she had 12 for the<br />\ngame) and feeding Harper for<br />\nthe easy baskets. Said Head<br />\nCoach Kay Fowler-Dressler,<br />\n\"Cindy and Dawn work well<br />\ntogether.\"<br />\nStill it wasn't enough. Many<br />\ntimes the Jays were able to<br />\nsurge to within three points, but<br />\neach time the Red Devils fought<br />\nthem off. Dickinson relied<br />\nmainly on a staple of inside<br />\npasses to their twin towers Amy<br /><br />\nBill Wallace<br />\nDawn Richards goes for the lay-up against Dickinson. The senior scored<br />\neight points as the Jays lost, 65-59.<br /><br />\nRoth and Nancy Oppenheimer,<br />\nwho converted most of their<br />\nshots for 26 and 10 points,<br />\nrespectively.<br />\nHarper's 15 second-half<br />\npoints kept the Jays close, but<br />\nwhen Richards fouled out with<br />\nthree minutes to go and the<br />\nscore narrowed to 55-53, they<br />\nbegan to falter. The Jays held<br />\non for another minute before<br />\nthe Red Devils were able to put<br />\nthem away. Said FowlerDressler, \"What really hurt us<br />\nwas that we were rushing our<br />\nshots at the end of the game.\"<br />\nFowler-Dressler saw many<br />\nbright spots in her team's performance despite the loss.<br />\n\"This was the most balanced<br />\nscoring game we've had,\" she<br />\nsaid.
