The<br />\nquality of student productions is not the question at issue since it varies<br />\nfrom activity to activity and from one production or issue of a publication to another. The question that is of importance to the campus is<br />\nthe seemingly growing lack of interest in extra-curricular activities.<br />\nThere are a number of manifestations at present that strongly support the impression that the members of the undergraduate body are<br />\nbecoming less and less inclined to indulge in student affairs. The<br />\nBarnstormers case is one indication of this new spirit; the critical state<br />\n\u2022of the Debating Council is another. However, other activities such as<br />\nthe Black and Blue Jay and the Hullabaloo are not suffering from a<br />\ndearth of staff members and candidates.<br />\nUndoubtedly there is not as much discussion and argument on the<br />\ncampus concerning activities as there was four years ago. Naturally<br />\nenough one is prone to believe that this lack of conversation on the<br />\ntopic of student activities can only mean that a large majority of the<br />\nundergraduates find little interest in such matters. Therefore, even<br />\nconsidering some contradictory features, we believe that interest in<br />\nstudent activities has suffered a sharp decline in the last four years.<br />\nThe fundamental reasons for this change in attitude are very difficult<br />\nto ascertain. The abolition of the freshman regulation that all yearlings<br />\nmust try out for one activity has had some effect. But in the days<br />\nwhen that ruling was in force many freshmen merely signed up as a<br />\ncandidate for one activity or another and never approached the office<br />\nagain. So the abolition of this rule cannot be the sole cause of the<br />\ndecline in interest. Many more men are going in for graduate work<br />\nsince the New Plan was established than ever before and consequently<br />\ncannot afford the time to work on activities. While the two explanations offered above have had their effect, yet they do not tell the whole<br />\nstory. Undergraduates today have experienced a change in their conception of relative values and the importance of being a \"big man<br />\non the campus\" has dropped far down the scale. The reason remains<br />\nobscure; perhaps freshmen today are a little more intelligent than they<br />\nhave been; perhaps a little more stupid. It all depends on your point<br />\nof view.<br />\n<br />\nT<br />\n<br />\nTHE BIG PROBLEM<br />\ngraduation approaches the members of the senior class are faced<br />\nASwith<br />\nthe problem of what vocation to choose. A great many<br />\nhave made up their minds, but a large proportion are vacillating between two or three possible alternatives and some have not the least<br />\nidea as to what branch of work shall claim them.<br />\nMost of the men about to leave college are greatly worried over the<br />\nfact that they shall choose some vocation and later find they have made<br />\na mistake. They are afraid that they shall be forced to change jobs<br />\nseveral times before finding their correct metier. Well, what of it?<br />\nOur advice to these men is to take the job which appeals to them<br />\nmost at present. If they don't like it after a fair trial, let them leave<br />\nit regardless of the immediate consequences. Let them change again<br />\nand again until they find their proper niche.<br />\nIf everyone were not afraid that \"people might think\" they were<br />\n\"quitters,\" the problem of choosing that first job would not appear so<br />\nmomentous.<br />\n<br />\nfamed dance troupe to perform for<br />\nthe students.

It seems an excellent idea<br />\nand any such move would most certainly be welcomed at Hopkins<br />\nwhere the process could at least be<br />\ntried out this coming June; we are<br />\nsure that no one would object.<br />\n* * *<br /><br />\nThen moving a bit west geographically, it has been discovered<br />\nthat at the Kansas \\Vesleyan University the seniors are truly appreciated for their learning and knowledge as they were recently treated<br />\nto a chicken dinner. Also it was<br />\nnoted that typists had won special<br />\nhonors for speed during a high-pressure contest. The nature of the contest is still a matter of question, but<br />\nfrom some that we have seen around<br />\nthe University, we would gladly be<br />\nwilling to take a chance in determining their technique.<br />\n* * *<br /><br />\nCandidatesfor<br />\nProduction Needed<br />\nAt the Barnstormers' rehearsal<br />\nlast Sunday, Walter B.

Follow them for your own<br />\nsatisfaction.<br /><br />\nEDITORIALS<br />\nTHE DECLINE OF STUDENT ACTIVITIES<br />\nHE number of recent appeals which the Barnstormers have made<br />\nfor candidates for their annual show brings to the fore the question<br />\nof whether or not student activities at Hopkins are deteriorating. The<br />\nquality of student productions is not the question at issue since it varies<br />\nfrom activity to activity and from one production or issue of a publication to another. The question that is of importance to the campus is<br />\nthe seemingly growing lack of interest in extra-curricular activities.<br />\nThere are a number of manifestations at present that strongly support the impression that the members of the undergraduate body are<br />\nbecoming less and less inclined to indulge in student affairs. The<br />\nBarnstormers case is one indication of this new spirit; the critical state<br />\n\u2022of the Debating Council is another. However, other activities such as<br />\nthe Black and Blue Jay and the Hullabaloo are not suffering from a<br />\ndearth of staff members and candidates.<br />\nUndoubtedly there is not as much discussion and argument on the<br />\ncampus concerning activities as there was four years ago. Naturally<br />\nenough one is prone to believe that this lack of conversation on the<br />\ntopic of student activities can only mean that a large majority of the<br />\nundergraduates find little interest in such matters. Therefore, even<br />\nconsidering some contradictory features, we believe that interest in<br />\nstudent activities has suffered a sharp decline in the last four years.<br />\nThe fundamental reasons for this change in attitude are very difficult<br />\nto ascertain. The abolition of the freshman regulation that all yearlings<br />\nmust try out for one activity has had some effect. But in the days<br />\nwhen that ruling was in force many freshmen merely signed up as a<br />\ncandidate for one activity or another and never approached the office<br />\nagain. So the abolition of this rule cannot be the sole cause of the<br />\ndecline in interest. Many more men are going in for graduate work<br />\nsince the New Plan was established than ever before and consequently<br />\ncannot afford the time to work on activities. While the two explanations offered above have had their effect, yet they do not tell the whole<br />\nstory. Undergraduates today have experienced a change in their conception of relative values and the importance of being a \"big man<br />\non the campus\" has dropped far down the scale. The reason remains<br />\nobscure; perhaps freshmen today are a little more intelligent than they<br />\nhave been; perhaps a little more stupid. It all depends on your point<br />\nof view.<br /><br />\nT<br /><br />\nTHE BIG PROBLEM<br />\ngraduation approaches the members of the senior class are faced<br />\nASwith<br />\nthe problem of what vocation to choose. A great many<br />\nhave made up their minds, but a large proportion are vacillating between two or three possible alternatives and some have not the least<br />\nidea as to what branch of work shall claim them.<br />\nMost of the men about to leave college are greatly worried over the<br />\nfact that they shall choose some vocation and later find they have made<br />\na mistake. They are afraid that they shall be forced to change jobs<br />\nseveral times before finding their correct metier. Well, what of it?<br />\nOur advice to these men is to take the job which appeals to them<br />\nmost at present. If they don't like it after a fair trial, let them leave<br />\nit regardless of the immediate consequences. Let them change again<br />\nand again until they find their proper niche.<br />\nIf everyone were not afraid that \"people might think\" they were<br />\n\"quitters,\" the problem of choosing that first job would not appear so<br />\nmomentous.<br /><br />\nfamed dance troupe to perform for<br />\nthe students.
