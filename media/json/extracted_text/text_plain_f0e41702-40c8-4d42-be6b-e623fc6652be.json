Lurin<br />\nOn Saturday, September 19,<br />\nwhen most of you were still sleeping, the officers of Alpha Epsilon<br />\nDelta, the Pre-Med Honor Society, were preparing for the first<br />\nsemi-annual Medical College Admission Test smorgasbord.<br />\nMany Hopkins students claim<br />\nthat the MCAT should be a<br />\nschool holiday, as it seems that<br />\neveryone goes through either the<br />\nagony of taking the test, or knows<br />\nsomeone who must. For those<br />\nfew who do not know, the MCAT<br />\nis an all-day exam given twice a<br />\nyear, and is required for admission to most medical schools.<br />\nIt is now divided into seven<br />\nsections, including physics,<br />\nbiology, chemistry, science problems, reading skills, quantitative<br />\nskills, and an essay. The exam<br />\nbegins at 8 am and can go on until 8 pm. There are breaks between some sections, the longest<br />\nbeing an hour for lunch.<br />\nMany students feel pressure<br />\nand preparing a lunch is probably<br />\nthe furthest thought from their<br />\nmind. Many students live ten to<br />\n<br />\nfifteen minutes from campus, so<br />\ngoing home for lunch can be a<br />\nproblem, and the tension that<br />\ngoes with nerves does not mix<br />\nwell with greasy fast foods, the<br />\nmost likely answer. So enter<br />\nAED.<br />\nThe Pre-Med Honor Society is<br />\ngoing through many changes. Its<br />\nofficers believe that there is plenty of room for development here<br />\nat Hopkins, and they want to<br />\nremove its weak image of years<br />\ngone by.<br />\nVice-President Glen Weiss said<br />\nthat sponsoring a lunch for<br />\nMCATers is a step in the right<br />\ndirection.<br />\nHe said, \"I feel that this is a<br />\nstep in the right direction. We<br />\nneed to show the school and the<br />\nstudent body that we take<br />\nourselves seriously. We hope to<br />\nbe more involved in the development of pre-meds here at Hopkins<br />\nand hope that events like this one<br />\nwill bring the students closer<br />\ntogether.\"<br />\nAbout seventy-five people<br />\ndropped by for cold-cuts and<br />\nsodas, all free.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/3<br />\n<br />\n\"HOW I MADE $18,000.<br />\nFOR COLLEGE<br />\nBY WORKING WEEKENDS.\"<br />\n<br />\nWhen my friends and I graduated<br />\nfrom high school, we all took part-time<br />\njobs to pay for college.<br />\nThey ended up in car washes and<br />\nhamburger joints, putting in long hours<br />\nfor little pay.<br />\nNot me.

Bellah,<br />\nprofessor of sociology at the University of California at<br />\nBerkeley. \"A continuing problem for theology,\" he says,<br />\n\"is that it's marginal and in many ways considered illegitimate. That makes theologians want to find ways to<br />\njoin the conversation, rather than being considered odd<br />\nand having these strange beliefs. The theologian who<br />\nwants to join the general intellectual conversation has to<br />\nbe attuned to what's going on.\"<br />\nIn history, says Paul Boyer, professor of history at the<br />\nUniversity of Wisconsin at Madison, \"the subdisciplines<br />\nare looking beyond themselves more than they have in<br />\nthe past.\" He adds: \"The best history is being done from<br />\na more integrated perspective.

Even in economics,<br />\nwhich many in and outside the field consider the most<br />\nhidebound of disciplines, researchers are extending traditional disciplinary boundaries to include such topics as<br />\nthe economics of the family and the politically oriented<br />\npublic-choice theories of the Nobel Prize winner James<br />\nM. Buchanan, professor of economics at George Mason<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nTo one degree or another, the increasing openness of<br />\nthe scholarly disciplines is evident in much of what<br />\nscholars report as some of the most provocative work in<br />\ntheir fields. Some examples among many:<br />\nThe psychology of health is a relatively new field of<br />\nstudy and one of the most exciting areas of research in<br />\nthe discipline, according to Bonnie R. Strickland, professor of psychology at the University of Massachusetts<br />\nat Amherst. Researchers are exploring the involvement<br />\nof psychological processes in all aspects of a person's<br />\nphysical well-being, including the connection between the<br />\nhuman psyche and the immune system.<br />\nThe \"global environment\" is a topic of growing concern to researchers in geography, says David Ward,<br />\nassociate dean of the graduate school and professor of<br />\n<br />\ngeography at the University of Wisconsin at Madison.<br />\nAs people around the world are forced to confront such<br />\nlarge-scale problems as tropical deforestation and the warming of the earth due to the \"greenhouse effect,\" researchers will more and more have to take a global perspective on environmental conditions and processes, particularly their impact on land use and human survival.<br />\n0.Cognitive archaeology\u2014some call it \"symbolic\" or<br />\n\"semiotic\" archaeology\u2014is a new attempt by researchers<br />\n\"to get into the heads of the ancients, particularly<br />\nprehistoric and non-literate people, through their<br />\nartifacts,\" says Thomas W.

Stewart, director of the black-studies program and<br />\nassociate professor of labor studies at Pennsylvania State<br />\nUniversity. \"The importance of that,\" he says, \"is to<br />\ntry to destroy the myth that rural African civilization<br />\nrepresents [the African people's) highest level of civilization.\"<br />\nOne facet of these and other researcher's ever-widening<br />\nperspective on their subjects is a growing appreciation,<br />\nnoted by scholars in virtually every field, of the importance of history\u2014or, more specifically, of the significance<br />\nof historical processes, the origins of things and their<br />\ndevelopment over time. \"It's not a new<br />\ninsight,\" as one sociologist puts it, \"but more people are<br />\nacting on it.\"<br />\nThat insight is being acted on in fields ranging from<br />\nliterature to psychology.<br />\nMark Abramson, a professor of sociology at the University of Connecticut who until last month was the program<br />\ndirector for sociology at the National Science Foundation, notes, for example, that a year or so ago the foun-<br />\n<br />\n\"I think it will be difficult in the<br />\nfuture for anyone to make a big name<br />\nfor themselvesjust by careful, elegant<br />\ntesting of a hypothesis.\"\u2014Lowi<br />\ndation examined its pattern of support in sociology and<br />\ndiscovered a significant increase in money for historically<br />\noriented research.

Those researchers use history because they need<br />\nit, he says. \"There's more of a sensitivity that, if you want to know<br />\nwhat's significant, you've got to<br />\nknow what's lasting.\"<br />\nTo Mr. Lowi's mind, however, the<br />\nhistorical bent in the work of many<br />\npolitical scientists is actually part of<br />\nanother, more fundamental trend that<br />\nhe and others note: a growing attention to theory, to constructing overarching explanations of events. History,<br />\nhe says, \"is a methodology imposed<br />\non those who would wish to be more<br />\ntheoretical.\"<br />\nIn political science, he says, the interest in theory drives what he sees<br />\nas two concurrent trends\u2014a<br />\n\"humanization\" of the science side<br />\nof the field and a search for ever more<br />\nsophisticated quantitative methods. \"1<br />\nthink it will be difficult in the future,\"<br />\nhe says, \"for anyone to make a big<br />\nname for themselves just by careful,<br />\nelegant testing of a hypothesis.

According to the California study, female<br />\nfaculty are found more in junior and<br />\nwomen's colleges than in major universities. They are usually concentrated in<br />\nfields often associated with women,<br />\nsuch as English and education, and are<br />\nconsistently paid less than their male<br />\ncolleagues, at all levels.<br />\nHopkins has traditionally proven to be<br />\nno exception to these attitudes towards<br />\nwomen. In December of 1984, the Ad<br />\nHoc Committee on the Status of Women<br />\nwas formed as a direct result of uproar<br />\nover the circulation of a graphic TEP<br />\nnewsletter, which sexually defamed<br />\nwomen in general. At the time of the<br />\ncommittee's report that following July,<br />\nthere were only eight tenured women in<br />\nthe Homewood community; tenured and<br />\ntenure-track women made up only seven<br />\npercent of the of the entire faculty.<br />\nThe Ad Hoc report alarmingly noted<br />\nthat women are even more underrepre-<br />\n<br />\nsented at Hopkins than at comparable<br />\ninstitutions; at that time, women made<br />\nup over 16 percent of the tenured and<br />\ntenure-track faculty of the top 50<br />\ndoctorate-granting institutions in the<br />\nUnited States. The paper went on to<br />\nissue recommendations for improvements in employment and working conditions at Homewood,faculty hiring and<br />\ncurriculum, and the establishment of a<br />\nWomen's Center at Homewood.<br />\nThe Committee's recommendations<br />\nhave begun to manifest themselves. This<br />\nfall, seven women joined the<br />\nHomewood faculty as assistant professors. This represents 25 percent of<br />\nthe new faculty hired this year, compared to five percent two years ago.<br />\nThe new professors have each joined<br />\na different department, ranging from<br />\nPhysics and Astronomy to English. This<br />\nis encouraging news for the Homewood<br />\ncommunity. But while steps have been<br />\ntaken to increase the number of women<br />\nin the faculty, the transition has been<br />\nslow.<br />\nLectures such as Sandler's achieve the<br />\ntwo-fold purpose of heightening<br />\nawareness of women's issues at<br />\nHomewood as well as providing the<br />\ncommunity with the opportunity to hear<br />\nthe words of some truly outstanding<br />\nwomen. But it is the department<br />\nchairmen and administration that really have the ability to balance the faculty ratio. It is our hope that they will, as<br />\nfaculty positions become available,<br />\nperceive their female applicants not as<br />\nopportunities to fulfill a quota, but as<br />\nequals of their male competition.<br />\n<br />\nA Landmark of History<br />\nGilman Hall is embued with the kind<br />\nof history to which Hopkins University<br />\nshould cling. It is named after Hopkins'<br />\nfirst president, Daniel Coit Gilman.<br />\nEven its architectural design was in part<br />\nconceived by an alumnus, Douglas H.<br />\nThomas Jr., of the Baltimore firm,<br />\nParker, Thomas and Rice. It is the embodiment of Hopkins' extension into the<br />\nfields of the Humanities and Social<br />\nSciences.<br />\nThe importance of Gilman does not<br />\nlie solely in its heritage. It is<br />\nHomewood's largest classroom and office facility. In addition, its size and<br />\ncentral location on campus have made<br />\nGilman attractive for other services to<br />\nthe community.<br />\nFurthermore, Gilman is. a beautiful<br />\nexample of collegiate Georgian revival<br />\nstyle architecture. Preserving this example has become the concern of the Commission on Historic and Architectural<br />\nPreservation (CHAP). In City Council<br />\nOrdinance 1764, CHAP recommends<br />\nthat Gilman be designated a historic<br />\nlandmark.<br />\n<br />\nThe administration is resisting the<br />\ndesignation\u2014 and with good reason.<br />\nThe ordinance, if passed, would require<br />\nthat any proposed changes in Gilman's<br />\nexterior would have to obtain CHAP's<br />\napproval in addition to the existing requirements from city agencies.<br />\nGilman's historical and emotional<br />\nrole at Hopkins is sufficient to insure<br />\nthat it will be well taken care of in the<br />\nfuture. The university does not have the<br />\nflexibility of space, however, not to<br />\nmake the most of every building.<br />\nThe services in the basement of<br />\nGilman would be well incorporated into a student union, one much more comprehensive than Levering Hall is today.<br />\nAlthough such a student union is only<br />\na hope for the not-too-distant future, the<br />\nfreeing-up of that basement space<br />\nshould be well used. Gilman's designation as a historic landmark would undoubtedly slow down, and might well<br />\ninterfere with its effective use, while<br />\nprotecting a landmark the university is<br />\nalready very sensitive to protect.<br />\n<br />\nA Little Leeway<br />\nby A. Lee Davis<br />\nI was perusing a class catalog<br />\nwhen a ferocious wind suddenly<br />\nripped the shade from my wall.<br />\nRaindrops as heavy as lead balls<br />\npoured through my window. A<br />\nburst of thunder and a flash of<br />\nlightning sent me scurrying to a<br />\ncorner. There I sat, wet, frightened. cowering under my desk.<br />\nFrom whence had this tempest<br />\ncome? Who had called it upon<br />\nme? \"Let me live,\" I cried, \"and<br />\nI shall find faith!\" No sooner had<br />\nthe words been uttered than the<br />\nclouds broke and shimmering<br />\nstars filled the sky.<br />\nOverwhelmed by the experience. I staggered to my desk,<br />\nand there, etched in the smoking<br />\nwood, was the cryptic message<br />\n\"TMWTT.\u2014 What could it<br />\nmean? I burst from the room and,<br />\nbarely able to enunciate the<br />\nwords. informed my neighbor of<br />\nthe events that had transpired.

Been studying hard? Your face buried in the books? Then you probably haven't had time to notice that there's a city<br />\nout there. That's right, that's not all wasteland between Homewood and the Harbor. Lots of students are noticing the first ways to get to know<br />\na city is to know what's going on in it.<br />\nThat's why there's this four-page pull-out. It has schedules and phone numbers you'll need to explore the cultural life of Baltimore. Sure, it's<br />\nnot Washington D.C. But Baltimore does have culture. In the past, students have pretty much restricted themselves to the Homewood campus,<br />\nsometimes never venturing farther than Wawa. Go out there. See a play. See a movie. Attend a concert.<br />\nThe shuttle can drop you off at Mt. Vernon Place, a major cultural center. Or, the 61 bus goes down St. Paul Street, and the 8 bus down<br />\nGreenmount.

The Federation of Students<br />\nfinancially supported the Orsers<br />\nwhen they first went to court.<br />\nAfter the couple won their case,<br />\nthe city appealed and the Federation again financed the Orsers'<br />\nfight.<br />\nThe city's appeal was successful, in turn, the Orsers have<br />\nbeen granted an appeal of their<br />\nown. News of the Orsers' appeal<br />\nbeing granted prompted the<br />\nFederation of Students to reconsider their decision not to help the<br />\n<br />\ncouple with their court costs, said<br />\nLisa Skinner, vice-president<br />\n(operations and finance).<br />\nThe application fly leave to appeal was exrected to cost approximately CDN$2.500 (Canadian)<br />\nand further court costs will run<br />\nsomewhere between CDN$5,000<br />\nand 57.500. said Federation of<br />\nStudents President Ted Carlton.<br />\nThe Federation's board of directors decided it could not bear the<br />\nfull cost. he said.<br />\nThe number of students affected by the City of Waterloo<br />\nzoning bylaw are few, said<br />\nCarlton. \"We should be directing<br />\nour energy through other channels,\u2014 he said.<br />\nThe Federation may look at ending the exclusionary bylaw by<br />\nlobbying city council, asking<br />\nthem to either change the zoning<br />\nor change the bylaw, said<br />\nCarlton. \"With the present city<br />\ncouncil that would realistically be<br />\na difficult task,\u2014 he said.<br />\nAs yet, none of these alternative methods to fight the city<br />\nare being carried out, said<br />\nCarlton. The Feds are just considering various options at this<br />\nstage, he said.<br />\nSkinner said the fight is also being carried out at the provincial<br />\nlevel by the Ontario Federation of<br />\nStudents (OFS).

That<br />\ncity's bylaw restricts the number<br />\nof unrelated people in a house to<br />\nfour. The Board decision, expected in November, should set<br />\nthe trend for all such appeals, said<br />\nSkinner.<br />\nThe lack of full.support from<br />\nthe Federation of Students has<br />\nforced the Orsers to look<br />\nelsewhere for money. So far they<br />\nhave raised about CDN$2,500,<br />\nincluding $250 from the Wilfrid<br />\nLaurier University Student<br />\nUnion, $200 from another<br />\nlandlord, and $200 from a local<br />\nreal estate office, said Ken Orser.<br />\nWhen they bought the house,<br />\nthe Orsers were told the bylaws<br />\nwere unenforced, he said.<br />\nHowever, about three to four<br />\nmonths after moving in they were<br />\ncharged with having too many<br />\npeople living there.<br />\nOrser said there are noise<br />\nbylaws, parking bylaws, and property standards bylaws. If the<br />\nneighbors have complaints with<br />\nthe students any of these bylaws<br />\ncan be enforced, he said. The<br />\nbylaw restricting the number of<br />\npeople to one house is<br />\ndiscriminatory, he said.<br />\nAt the time the Orsers were<br />\ncharged, there were eight<br />\nstudents living in the house as<br />\nwell as the Orsers themselves.<br />\nWith the number of students<br />\nrestricted to those allowed by the<br />\nbylaw, the couple can probably<br />\nafford to keep the house for a few<br />\nmonths, said Orser.

Johns Hopkins Hospital<br />\nhas one of the largest academic<br />\nunits of allergy -and asthma in the<br />\ncountry, if not the world, boasts<br />\nDr. Franklin Adkinson, Professor<br />\nof Allergy and Clinical Immunology at Hopkins Hospital.<br />\nAccording to Adkinson, in the<br />\n1960's, the department pioneered<br />\nthe use of allergy injections as<br />\ntreatment for hay fever. The<br />\ndepartment has allergy clinics at<br />\nboth Hopkins Hospital and Good<br />\nSamaritan Hospital.<br />\nAllergic Rhinitis became known<br />\nas hay fever because it<br />\npredominantly affected farmers<br />\nwho pitched hay at the end of the<br />\nsummer. The term Allergic<br />\nRhinitis refers to all allergies that<br />\naffect the nose and eyes, and are<br />\ncaused by airborne particles of<br />\nbiological ofigin, such as pollen<br />\nand mold spores. The season of<br />\nsuch allergies is from March<br />\nthrough November. peaking at<br />\nthis time, from Labor Day until<br />\nthe first frost in mid-November.<br />\nSimilar reactions to animal hair<br />\ncan occur year-round. The symptoms include congestion,. mucus<br />\nsecretion, sneezing, and itchy<br />\neyes. Over twenty million<br />\nAmericans are afflicted with hay<br />\nfever, yet most probably do not<br />\nunderstand the causes of this<br />\ncommon malady.<br />\nAdkinson explains that an<br />\nallergic reaction to a specific particle, such as ragweed, is<br />\ndeveloped soon after birth, and<br />\n<br />\ncontinues to develop during the<br />\nyounger years, reaching a peak<br />\ndurihg the late teenage-college<br />\nyears. During later years, the<br />\nreaction generally subsides. Hay<br />\nfever is caused by protein particles in pollen that cause the formation of Immunoglobulin E.<br />\n(IGE) antibodies. These antibodies 'sit' attached to receptors. on the white basal cells in<br />\nthe bloodstream, and on the mast<br />\ncells in the skin and nose. When<br />\nthe protein particle, called an<br />\nallergen, attaches to the antibody,<br />\nthe receptors interact with each<br />\nother, causing the chemical<br />\nhistamine to be secreted by the<br />\ncells, yielding the hay fever<br />\nsymptoms.<br />\nThere are many treatments for<br />\nhay fever, and they vary in effectiveness from person to person, as<br />\nAdkinson delineates. The first<br />\nline of defense is avoidance. This<br />\nis the optimal cure. with no side<br />\neffects, yet is usually impractical.<br />\nAir filtration and air condition<br />\nunits help eliminate allergens to<br />\nsome extent.<br />\nOver-the-counter antihistamines, such as Benadryl or<br />\nChlor Trimeton, are the most<br />\ncommon treatments for hay<br />\nlever. These drugs, as their<br />\nnames suggest. compete for<br />\nhistamine receptor sites, with the<br />\nhistamine secreted by the mast<br />\ncells, causing the symptoms to<br />\nsubside.

The only down note<br />\nwas a 2-0 loss to Gettysburg on<br />\nthe previous Thursday. The 2-1<br />\nrecord for the week brings the<br />\nLady Jays' totals to four wins and<br />\nonly one loss, their best start in<br />\nrecent years.<br />\nAccording to coach Sally Beth<br />\nAnderson, senior Heather Klink<br />\nwas one of the key players in the<br />\nUMBC trouncing. \"Just like Patti<br />\nOrdonez sparked the team on<br />\nSaturday against Dickinson,<br />\nHeather was the 'spark-of-theday' today against UMBC.\"<br />\nIn the Dickinson contest, JHU<br />\njumped ahead 2-0 in the first half,<br />\na lead that turned out to be insurmountable. Klink opened the<br />\nscoring four minutes into the<br />\ngame by shooting in a deflection<br />\noff a Dickinson defender. Ordonez tallied Hopkins' second<br />\ngoal, and after Dickinson scored<br />\ntheir only point, April Savoye<br />\ntapped in a pass from Klink to ice<br />\nthe victory late in the first half.<br />\nA solid defensive effort shut out<br />\nDickinson in the second half.<br />\nIn the scoring fest against<br />\nUMBC, Savoye deflected in a<br />\n<br />\nKlink free hit for the first goal<br />\nKacie White scored the second<br />\ngoal on a penalty corner on a pass<br />\nfrom Jackie Fatula.<br />\nSavoye scored her second, and<br />\nHopkins' third, of the game on<br />\nanother penalty corner. Fatula<br />\nthen scored just nine seconds later<br />\nafter chasing the ball down field<br />\nand flicking in the goalie's rebound. Thirty-four seconds into<br />\nthe second half, Rowena Tena<br />\npushed in Julie Siegrist's shot-ongoal to raise the score to 5-0.<br />\nFatula then flicked in the last goal<br />\nafter a scramble in front of the<br />\ncage.<br />\nGoalie Jen O'Hara earned her<br />\nfirst shut-out of the year, due to<br />\na great performance from O'Hara<br />\nand the defense. \"Freshman<br />\nMeredith Blitz has been very consistant at left halfback. She played<br />\na great game and has been very<br />\ndependable,\" Anderson stated.<br />\nAnderson was pleased to have<br />\nsuch a big win over a Division I<br />\nschool, but she also noted that the<br />\nmost important games are coming up, when the team faces<br />\nMAC division rivals Franklin &<br />\nMarshall at Homewood on<br />\nThursday, September 24 and<br />\nJuniata away on Saturday.

For those<br />\nfew who do not know, the MCAT<br />\nis an all-day exam given twice a<br />\nyear, and is required for admission to most medical schools.<br />\nIt is now divided into seven<br />\nsections, including physics,<br />\nbiology, chemistry, science problems, reading skills, quantitative<br />\nskills, and an essay. The exam<br />\nbegins at 8 am and can go on until 8 pm. There are breaks between some sections, the longest<br />\nbeing an hour for lunch.<br />\nMany students feel pressure<br />\nand preparing a lunch is probably<br />\nthe furthest thought from their<br />\nmind. Many students live ten to<br /><br />\nfifteen minutes from campus, so<br />\ngoing home for lunch can be a<br />\nproblem, and the tension that<br />\ngoes with nerves does not mix<br />\nwell with greasy fast foods, the<br />\nmost likely answer.

Reprinted with<br />\npermission.<br />\nListen this year to scholars in the humanities and the<br />\nsocial sciences talk about their work and you hear the<br />\nsound of barriers coming down.<br />\nReflecting on the present and future state of their fields,<br />\nscholars speak out about how the boundaries of their<br />\ndisciplines are \"extending\" or \"breaking down,\" about<br />\nhow their own perspectives are \"broadening.\" They talk<br />\nof \"looking beyond themselves\" and of \"joining the<br />\ngeneral intellectual conversation.\"<br />\nThey are referring not so much to interdisciplinary work<br />\n\u2014though that is prevalent\u2014as to a continuing evolution<br />\nin their understanding of what constitutes history or<br />\nsociology or philosophy or literary studies. In field after<br />\nfield, although the verses may be different, the refrain<br />\nis the same.<br />\nSpecialists in religion, for example, are taking more<br />\nand more interest in developments outside their usual domain of sacred texts and doctrines, says Robert N. Bellah,<br />\nprofessor of sociology at the University of California at<br />\nBerkeley. \"A continuing problem for theology,\" he says,<br />\n\"is that it's marginal and in many ways considered illegitimate. That makes theologians want to find ways to<br />\njoin the conversation, rather than being considered odd<br />\nand having these strange beliefs. The theologian who<br />\nwants to join the general intellectual conversation has to<br />\nbe attuned to what's going on.\"<br />\nIn history, says Paul Boyer, professor of history at the<br />\nUniversity of Wisconsin at Madison, \"the subdisciplines<br />\nare looking beyond themselves more than they have in<br />\nthe past.\" He adds: \"The best history is being done from<br />\na more integrated perspective. Historians are broaden-<br /><br />\n\"What can we learn, say, from ancient systems of measurement, or<br />\nweights, about the way the creators of<br />\nthat system of weights ordered their<br />\nworld.\"\u2014Thomas W. Jacobsen<br />\ning their definitions of what you have to look at to do<br />\nhistory within various specialties.\"<br />\nThat situation holds in philosophy, too, says Samuel<br />\nGorovitz, dean of arts and science and professor of<br />\nphilosophy at Syracuse University. \"The sense of agenda, of methodology, of what counts as relevant literature,<br />\nor what count as legitimate questions and answers\u2014that<br />\nhas all expanded quite dramatically,\" he says.<br />\nIn the same way, musicologists are looking beyond the<br />\nclassical traditions of European music, and literary<br />\nscholars are continually redefining and expanding their<br />\nidea of what constitutes a literary text. Even in economics,<br />\nwhich many in and outside the field consider the most<br />\nhidebound of disciplines, researchers are extending traditional disciplinary boundaries to include such topics as<br />\nthe economics of the family and the politically oriented<br />\npublic-choice theories of the Nobel Prize winner James<br />\nM. Buchanan, professor of economics at George Mason<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nTo one degree or another, the increasing openness of<br />\nthe scholarly disciplines is evident in much of what<br />\nscholars report as some of the most provocative work in<br />\ntheir fields. Some examples among many:<br />\nThe psychology of health is a relatively new field of<br />\nstudy and one of the most exciting areas of research in<br />\nthe discipline, according to Bonnie R. Strickland, professor of psychology at the University of Massachusetts<br />\nat Amherst. Researchers are exploring the involvement<br />\nof psychological processes in all aspects of a person's<br />\nphysical well-being, including the connection between the<br />\nhuman psyche and the immune system.<br />\nThe \"global environment\" is a topic of growing concern to researchers in geography, says David Ward,<br />\nassociate dean of the graduate school and professor of<br /><br />\ngeography at the University of Wisconsin at Madison.<br />\nAs people around the world are forced to confront such<br />\nlarge-scale problems as tropical deforestation and the warming of the earth due to the \"greenhouse effect,\" researchers will more and more have to take a global perspective on environmental conditions and processes, particularly their impact on land use and human survival.<br />\n0.Cognitive archaeology\u2014some call it \"symbolic\" or<br />\n\"semiotic\" archaeology\u2014is a new attempt by researchers<br />\n\"to get into the heads of the ancients, particularly<br />\nprehistoric and non-literate people, through their<br />\nartifacts,\" says Thomas W. Jacobsen, professor of<br />\nclassical archaeology and classical studies at Indiana<br />\nUniversity. \"What can we learn, say, from ancient<br />\nsystems of measurement, or weights, about the way the<br /><br />\n\"There's more of a sensitivity that,<br />\nif you want to know what's significant,<br />\nyou've got to know what's lasting.\"<br />\n\u2014Theodore J.

Stiglitz, professor of economics at<br />\nPrinceton University. \"The older economics had a certain engineering characteristic,\" he says. \"Economics<br />\nnow focuses much more on incentives and indirect control.\"<br />\nIIP-The study of classic African civilizations and of the<br />\nAfrican origins of Western civilization is \"one of the more<br />\nprovocative and challenging areas\" in black studies, taking scholars back beyond the field's traditional focus on<br />\nslavery and the African-American experience, says James<br />\nB. Stewart, director of the black-studies program and<br />\nassociate professor of labor studies at Pennsylvania State<br />\nUniversity. \"The importance of that,\" he says, \"is to<br />\ntry to destroy the myth that rural African civilization<br />\nrepresents [the African people's) highest level of civilization.\"<br />\nOne facet of these and other researcher's ever-widening<br />\nperspective on their subjects is a growing appreciation,<br />\nnoted by scholars in virtually every field, of the importance of history\u2014or, more specifically, of the significance<br />\nof historical processes, the origins of things and their<br />\ndevelopment over time. \"It's not a new<br />\ninsight,\" as one sociologist puts it, \"but more people are<br />\nacting on it.\"<br />\nThat insight is being acted on in fields ranging from<br />\nliterature to psychology.<br />\nMark Abramson, a professor of sociology at the University of Connecticut who until last month was the program<br />\ndirector for sociology at the National Science Foundation, notes, for example, that a year or so ago the foun-<br /><br />\n\"I think it will be difficult in the<br />\nfuture for anyone to make a big name<br />\nfor themselvesjust by careful, elegant<br />\ntesting of a hypothesis.\"\u2014Lowi<br />\ndation examined its pattern of support in sociology and<br />\ndiscovered a significant increase in money for historically<br />\noriented research. Among sociologists the interest is not<br />\nin history itself, Mr. Abramson says, but in a turning away<br />\nfrom the study of static phenomena to the investigation<br />\nof development, process, and change in social<br />\ninteractions.<br />\nJust so, psychology is growing more \"process-oriented,\" researchers say, and longitudinal studies, which track<br />\npsychological change and development in subjects over<br />\nlong periods of time, are increasingly prominent in the<br />\nfield<br /><br />\nSee DISCIPLINS,,5<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/5<br /><br />\nPresidential candidates speak out on education<br />\nCopyright 1987, The Chronicle of<br />\nHigher Education.

Lowi, professor of<br />\ngovernment at Cornell University,<br />\npoints to a new historical slant on the<br />\nstudy of the Presidency, a staple of<br />\npolitical science, among researchers<br />\ninterested not so much in individual<br />\nchief executives as in how the office<br />\nitself got to where it is. Those researchers use history because they need<br />\nit, he says. \"There's more of a sensitivity that, if you want to know<br />\nwhat's significant, you've got to<br />\nknow what's lasting.\"<br />\nTo Mr. Lowi's mind, however, the<br />\nhistorical bent in the work of many<br />\npolitical scientists is actually part of<br />\nanother, more fundamental trend that<br />\nhe and others note: a growing attention to theory, to constructing overarching explanations of events. History,<br />\nhe says, \"is a methodology imposed<br />\non those who would wish to be more<br />\ntheoretical.\"<br />\nIn political science, he says, the interest in theory drives what he sees<br />\nas two concurrent trends\u2014a<br />\n\"humanization\" of the science side<br />\nof the field and a search for ever more<br />\nsophisticated quantitative methods. \"1<br />\nthink it will be difficult in the future,\"<br />\nhe says, \"for anyone to make a big<br />\nname for themselves just by careful,<br />\nelegant testing of a hypothesis.

According to the California study, female<br />\nfaculty are found more in junior and<br />\nwomen's colleges than in major universities. They are usually concentrated in<br />\nfields often associated with women,<br />\nsuch as English and education, and are<br />\nconsistently paid less than their male<br />\ncolleagues, at all levels.<br />\nHopkins has traditionally proven to be<br />\nno exception to these attitudes towards<br />\nwomen. In December of 1984, the Ad<br />\nHoc Committee on the Status of Women<br />\nwas formed as a direct result of uproar<br />\nover the circulation of a graphic TEP<br />\nnewsletter, which sexually defamed<br />\nwomen in general. At the time of the<br />\ncommittee's report that following July,<br />\nthere were only eight tenured women in<br />\nthe Homewood community; tenured and<br />\ntenure-track women made up only seven<br />\npercent of the of the entire faculty.<br />\nThe Ad Hoc report alarmingly noted<br />\nthat women are even more underrepre-<br /><br />\nsented at Hopkins than at comparable<br />\ninstitutions; at that time, women made<br />\nup over 16 percent of the tenured and<br />\ntenure-track faculty of the top 50<br />\ndoctorate-granting institutions in the<br />\nUnited States. The paper went on to<br />\nissue recommendations for improvements in employment and working conditions at Homewood,faculty hiring and<br />\ncurriculum, and the establishment of a<br />\nWomen's Center at Homewood.<br />\nThe Committee's recommendations<br />\nhave begun to manifest themselves. This<br />\nfall, seven women joined the<br />\nHomewood faculty as assistant professors. This represents 25 percent of<br />\nthe new faculty hired this year, compared to five percent two years ago.<br />\nThe new professors have each joined<br />\na different department, ranging from<br />\nPhysics and Astronomy to English. This<br />\nis encouraging news for the Homewood<br />\ncommunity. But while steps have been<br />\ntaken to increase the number of women<br />\nin the faculty, the transition has been<br />\nslow.<br />\nLectures such as Sandler's achieve the<br />\ntwo-fold purpose of heightening<br />\nawareness of women's issues at<br />\nHomewood as well as providing the<br />\ncommunity with the opportunity to hear<br />\nthe words of some truly outstanding<br />\nwomen. But it is the department<br />\nchairmen and administration that really have the ability to balance the faculty ratio. It is our hope that they will, as<br />\nfaculty positions become available,<br />\nperceive their female applicants not as<br />\nopportunities to fulfill a quota, but as<br />\nequals of their male competition.<br /><br />\nA Landmark of History<br />\nGilman Hall is embued with the kind<br />\nof history to which Hopkins University<br />\nshould cling. It is named after Hopkins'<br />\nfirst president, Daniel Coit Gilman.<br />\nEven its architectural design was in part<br />\nconceived by an alumnus, Douglas H.<br />\nThomas Jr., of the Baltimore firm,<br />\nParker, Thomas and Rice. It is the embodiment of Hopkins' extension into the<br />\nfields of the Humanities and Social<br />\nSciences.<br />\nThe importance of Gilman does not<br />\nlie solely in its heritage. It is<br />\nHomewood's largest classroom and office facility. In addition, its size and<br />\ncentral location on campus have made<br />\nGilman attractive for other services to<br />\nthe community.<br />\nFurthermore, Gilman is. a beautiful<br />\nexample of collegiate Georgian revival<br />\nstyle architecture. Preserving this example has become the concern of the Commission on Historic and Architectural<br />\nPreservation (CHAP). In City Council<br />\nOrdinance 1764, CHAP recommends<br />\nthat Gilman be designated a historic<br />\nlandmark.<br /><br />\nThe administration is resisting the<br />\ndesignation\u2014 and with good reason.<br />\nThe ordinance, if passed, would require<br />\nthat any proposed changes in Gilman's<br />\nexterior would have to obtain CHAP's<br />\napproval in addition to the existing requirements from city agencies.<br />\nGilman's historical and emotional<br />\nrole at Hopkins is sufficient to insure<br />\nthat it will be well taken care of in the<br />\nfuture. The university does not have the<br />\nflexibility of space, however, not to<br />\nmake the most of every building.<br />\nThe services in the basement of<br />\nGilman would be well incorporated into a student union, one much more comprehensive than Levering Hall is today.<br />\nAlthough such a student union is only<br />\na hope for the not-too-distant future, the<br />\nfreeing-up of that basement space<br />\nshould be well used. Gilman's designation as a historic landmark would undoubtedly slow down, and might well<br />\ninterfere with its effective use, while<br />\nprotecting a landmark the university is<br />\nalready very sensitive to protect.<br /><br />\nA Little Leeway<br />\nby A.

Been studying hard? Your face buried in the books? Then you probably haven't had time to notice that there's a city<br />\nout there. That's right, that's not all wasteland between Homewood and the Harbor. Lots of students are noticing the first ways to get to know<br />\na city is to know what's going on in it.<br />\nThat's why there's this four-page pull-out. It has schedules and phone numbers you'll need to explore the cultural life of Baltimore. Sure, it's<br />\nnot Washington D.C. But Baltimore does have culture. In the past, students have pretty much restricted themselves to the Homewood campus,<br />\nsometimes never venturing farther than Wawa. Go out there. See a play. See a movie. Attend a concert.<br />\nThe shuttle can drop you off at Mt. Vernon Place, a major cultural center. Or, the 61 bus goes down St. Paul Street, and the 8 bus down<br />\nGreenmount. There are a lot of inexpensive things to do. And many expensive places have Student Rush tickets, where you get in for less than<br />\na quarter the regular price if you just show up half an hour before performance and it's not sold out.<br />\nSo pull this section out, and tack it to your wall. Wouldn't it be a waste to spend four years in Baltimore, and leave it knowing nothing about<br />\nthe city except where the Rotunda is? You owe it to Baltimore, if not to yourself.<br /><br />\nA fabulous fall film feast for you<br />\nBALTIMORE FILM FORUM<br />\nThe Film Forum shows its films in the<br />\nBMA.

Johns Hopkins Hospital<br />\nhas one of the largest academic<br />\nunits of allergy -and asthma in the<br />\ncountry, if not the world, boasts<br />\nDr. Franklin Adkinson, Professor<br />\nof Allergy and Clinical Immunology at Hopkins Hospital.<br />\nAccording to Adkinson, in the<br />\n1960's, the department pioneered<br />\nthe use of allergy injections as<br />\ntreatment for hay fever. The<br />\ndepartment has allergy clinics at<br />\nboth Hopkins Hospital and Good<br />\nSamaritan Hospital.<br />\nAllergic Rhinitis became known<br />\nas hay fever because it<br />\npredominantly affected farmers<br />\nwho pitched hay at the end of the<br />\nsummer. The term Allergic<br />\nRhinitis refers to all allergies that<br />\naffect the nose and eyes, and are<br />\ncaused by airborne particles of<br />\nbiological ofigin, such as pollen<br />\nand mold spores. The season of<br />\nsuch allergies is from March<br />\nthrough November. peaking at<br />\nthis time, from Labor Day until<br />\nthe first frost in mid-November.<br />\nSimilar reactions to animal hair<br />\ncan occur year-round. The symptoms include congestion,. mucus<br />\nsecretion, sneezing, and itchy<br />\neyes. Over twenty million<br />\nAmericans are afflicted with hay<br />\nfever, yet most probably do not<br />\nunderstand the causes of this<br />\ncommon malady.<br />\nAdkinson explains that an<br />\nallergic reaction to a specific particle, such as ragweed, is<br />\ndeveloped soon after birth, and<br /><br />\ncontinues to develop during the<br />\nyounger years, reaching a peak<br />\ndurihg the late teenage-college<br />\nyears. During later years, the<br />\nreaction generally subsides. Hay<br />\nfever is caused by protein particles in pollen that cause the formation of Immunoglobulin E.<br />\n(IGE) antibodies. These antibodies 'sit' attached to receptors. on the white basal cells in<br />\nthe bloodstream, and on the mast<br />\ncells in the skin and nose. When<br />\nthe protein particle, called an<br />\nallergen, attaches to the antibody,<br />\nthe receptors interact with each<br />\nother, causing the chemical<br />\nhistamine to be secreted by the<br />\ncells, yielding the hay fever<br />\nsymptoms.<br />\nThere are many treatments for<br />\nhay fever, and they vary in effectiveness from person to person, as<br />\nAdkinson delineates. The first<br />\nline of defense is avoidance. This<br />\nis the optimal cure. with no side<br />\neffects, yet is usually impractical.<br />\nAir filtration and air condition<br />\nunits help eliminate allergens to<br />\nsome extent.<br />\nOver-the-counter antihistamines, such as Benadryl or<br />\nChlor Trimeton, are the most<br />\ncommon treatments for hay<br />\nlever. These drugs, as their<br />\nnames suggest. compete for<br />\nhistamine receptor sites, with the<br />\nhistamine secreted by the mast<br />\ncells, causing the symptoms to<br />\nsubside. The side effects include<br />\ndrowsiness, which occurs when<br />\nthe antihistamine is carried to the<br />\nbrain where it stimulates receptors, causing sleep. Most overthe-counter drugs also contain a<br />\ndecongestant. For those people<br />\nwho cannot handle the sleepy side<br />\neffects, researchers have<br />\ndeveloped<br />\nnon -sedating<br />\nhistamines, which are available<br />\nby prescription only, and are very<br /><br />\nRichard Bell<br /><br />\nInnocent looking greenery like this can be a hay fever sufferers' worst enemy during these weeks of late summer and early autumn. Gersundheit!<br /><br />\ncostly.<br />\nFor most sufferers, the antihistamines are sufficient to make the<br />\nsymptoms bearable. However,<br />\nother treatments are available.<br />\nand researchers are developing<br />\nnew drugs and other treatments to<br />\nrelieve the discomfort. Two new<br />\ndrugs. Cromolyn and steroid<br />\npreparations are taken by nasal<br />\ninhalation, and are stronger than<br />\nthe antihistamines.<br />\nThe steroids remain in the<br />\nnose. and do not enter the<br />\nbloodstream, preventing side effects. The final line of defense<br />\nthat has been developed as of today are the allergy injections.<br />\ncalled immuno-therapy. The protein of the allergen is injected into the bloodstrem to stimulate a<br />\nprotective antibody response. The<br />\nmajor side effect is that another<br />\nallergic reaction, besides the<br />\nrhinitis. can develop, and does in<br />\nabout one-third of the patients<br /><br />\nwho receive injections. Current<br />\nresearch includes the development of new injections, with<br />\nfewer side effects, and a decreased frequency of injection.<br />\nAccording to Adkinson, \u2022 the<br />\nmost exciting research being conducted leads toward a cure for<br />\nhay fever and related allergies.<br />\nResearchers are attempting to<br />\ndevelop a method to 'trick' the<br />\nbody into suppressing the formation of the allergy - causing IGE<br />\nantibodies by introducing<br />\nmodified allergens to the patient.<br />\nApparently, during the evolutionary process, these antibodies<br />\nfought off parasites, and still do<br />\nso in Africa and Asia. Dr. Adkinson says that interesting<br />\nepidemiologic studies ha x c shown<br />\nthat natives of Africa for whom<br />\nthese antibodies still serve a purpose. have a lower incidence of<br />\nhay fever. Adkinson believes that<br />\nin America and other developed<br /><br />\ncountries. V, here parasitic inkclion is not a threat, hopefully this<br />\nimmunity response can he suppressed, therein producing a cure<br />\nfor hay fever.<br />\nFor those people currently suffering Nk ith hay fever, here are a<br />\nfew suggestions:<br />\nFirst, please do not use this article as a tissue.

In a tough league<br />\nof 23 teams, the Jays seek to improve their ninth place finish of<br />\nlast year. Co-captains Espenhorst<br />\nand Baker lead the team with<br />\nMarean as the best runner on the<br />\nteam. Marean finished first in a<br />\n3.5 mile road race at Westminster<br />\nthis past Sunday.<br />\nThe speedsters are away for the<br />\nrest of the season.

They<br />\nouthustled a tough Salisbury team<br />\non both offense and defense,<br />\nmaintaining constant pressure on<br />\ntheir inner-state rivals. In the end,<br />\nthe Blue Jays came away with a<br />\n2-0 victory and some momentum<br />\nfor Saturday's game against<br />\nHaverford.<br />\nBoth Hopkins goals came on<br />\ncorner kicks. The first kick from<br />\nKevin Flynn went through the<br />\ngoalie's hands, and when a<br />\nSalisbury fullback attempted to<br />\nclear the ball, Warren Jones put<br />\nit in the net for the Blue Jays. The<br />\nsecond corner kick was the same<br />\nstory, except this time Flynn's<br />\nkick went through the goalie's<br />\nhands and into the net.<br />\nPerhaps the brightest part of the<br />\ngame for Hopkins was the performance of the defense. After shaky<br />\noutings in the Elizabethtown<br />\nRichard Bell<br />\nTournament, the stoppers finally<br />\nWednesday afterplayed up to their capabilities.<br />\nUnusually, they did it without tricaptain Steve Gallo, who was out<br />\nwith an injury. To fill in, Matt<br />\nLawrence was moved to sweeper,<br />\nand Staunton Golding was forced into a starting role. It didn't<br />\nseem to matter, however, as Eric<br />\nShaw made five saves, and the<br />\ndefense used constant pressure to<br />\nrecord its second shut-out of the<br />\nyear.<br />\nSo the Hopkins soccer team has<br />\npassed its first test of the week<br />\nwith flying colors, but a far<br />\ngreater challenge awaits them.<br />\nOn Saturday, the Blue Jays, the<br />\ndefending league champs, host<br />\nHaverford at 2 p.m. in their conference opener. Not only is the<br />\ngame important in the conference<br />\nstandings, but Haverford is<br />\nreceiving national recognition. A<br />\nHopkins victory would indeed put<br />\nthe Blue Jays back in the hunt for<br />\nan NCAA Tournament bid.<br />\nBefore the game, the Athletic<br />\nCenter is sponsoring a reunion of<br />\nthe 52 years of Hopkins soccer<br />\nalumni. There will be a pre-game<br />\nluncheon and celebration for the<br />\nalumni and, following the game,<br />\nthere will be a reception for the<br />\nteam and parents.<br /><br />\nANNOUNCING SUPER SAVINGS<br />\nON MACINTOSH\" COMPUTERS<br />\nThey pack a lot of power and performance into very<br />\nlittle space.

The only down note<br />\nwas a 2-0 loss to Gettysburg on<br />\nthe previous Thursday. The 2-1<br />\nrecord for the week brings the<br />\nLady Jays' totals to four wins and<br />\nonly one loss, their best start in<br />\nrecent years.<br />\nAccording to coach Sally Beth<br />\nAnderson, senior Heather Klink<br />\nwas one of the key players in the<br />\nUMBC trouncing. \"Just like Patti<br />\nOrdonez sparked the team on<br />\nSaturday against Dickinson,<br />\nHeather was the 'spark-of-theday' today against UMBC.\"<br />\nIn the Dickinson contest, JHU<br />\njumped ahead 2-0 in the first half,<br />\na lead that turned out to be insurmountable. Klink opened the<br />\nscoring four minutes into the<br />\ngame by shooting in a deflection<br />\noff a Dickinson defender. Ordonez tallied Hopkins' second<br />\ngoal, and after Dickinson scored<br />\ntheir only point, April Savoye<br />\ntapped in a pass from Klink to ice<br />\nthe victory late in the first half.<br />\nA solid defensive effort shut out<br />\nDickinson in the second half.<br />\nIn the scoring fest against<br />\nUMBC, Savoye deflected in a<br /><br />\nKlink free hit for the first goal<br />\nKacie White scored the second<br />\ngoal on a penalty corner on a pass<br />\nfrom Jackie Fatula.<br />\nSavoye scored her second, and<br />\nHopkins' third, of the game on<br />\nanother penalty corner. Fatula<br />\nthen scored just nine seconds later<br />\nafter chasing the ball down field<br />\nand flicking in the goalie's rebound. Thirty-four seconds into<br />\nthe second half, Rowena Tena<br />\npushed in Julie Siegrist's shot-ongoal to raise the score to 5-0.<br />\nFatula then flicked in the last goal<br />\nafter a scramble in front of the<br />\ncage.<br />\nGoalie Jen O'Hara earned her<br />\nfirst shut-out of the year, due to<br />\na great performance from O'Hara<br />\nand the defense. \"Freshman<br />\nMeredith Blitz has been very consistant at left halfback. She played<br />\na great game and has been very<br />\ndependable,\" Anderson stated.<br />\nAnderson was pleased to have<br />\nsuch a big win over a Division I<br />\nschool, but she also noted that the<br />\nmost important games are coming up, when the team faces<br />\nMAC division rivals Franklin &amp;<br />\nMarshall at Homewood on<br />\nThursday, September 24 and<br />\nJuniata away on Saturday.
