Popularly, nylon is said to be made from<br />\ncoal, air and water. This is because<br />\noriginally, in developing its chemical intermediates,chemists used benzene (from coal), ammonia (from air<br />\nand water), and oxygen (from air).<br />\nBut Du Pont is alivays looking for<br />\nnew ways of doing things. After the<br />\ndiscovery of nylon in 1934, research<br />\nmen immediately began looking for<br />\nalternative ways of making the two<br />\nmain intermediates\u2014 adipic acid and<br />\nhexamethylenediamine. In 1935,<br />\nwhen nylon was still in the laboratory stage and three years before its<br />\ncommercial debut,they started work<br />\non the. possibility of using furfural<br />\nin the process.<br />\n<br />\ncyanide available for converting the<br />\n1,4-dichlorobutane into adiponitrile.<br />\n<br />\nThis is an excellent example of the<br />\ninteresting work in industrial organic<br />\nchemistry carried on at Du Pont. It<br />\nrequired the technical knowledge and<br />\n'skill of highly trained research and<br />\ndevelopment men, including organic<br />\nand physical chemists; chemical, mechanical, civil and electrical engineers, and others.<br />\nC. R. Dewey, B. S. Chem., Niagara University, 1941, and J. M. Estes, B.S. Ch.E., University of Missouri, 1937, engaged in production of adiponitrile at the Du Pont Elextrochemicals plant in Niagara Falls, New York.<br />\n<br />\n14 Years of Research<br />\nand Development<br />\nIt seems a far cry from corncobs to<br />\nnylon, and it was. The development<br />\nfrom the first small-scale laboratory<br />\nexperiments to the present full-scale<br />\nplant cost 14 years of time and about<br />\nfive million dollars. But it enabled<br />\nchemists to produce large quantities<br />\nof adiponitrile, the compound from<br />\nwhich hexamethylenediamine is<br />\nmade, by an economical process<br />\nwhich uses natural materials that<br />\nare in continuous supply.<br />\nIn the new process,furfural is converted by a series of steps to 1,4-dichlorobutane.

The general campus<br />\nopinion was that JHU was pioneering iu the field of \"de-emphasis\"\u2014<br />\nthat the Admissions officers would take an athlete with good grades<br />\nif he applied, but that they wouldn't bother to go around the corner<br />\nto find one.<br />\n<br />\nSquad.<br />\nFor 36 minutes of last Friday<br />\nnight's 50-45 loss to Wagner, the<br />\ncagers' debut under Bilgrav was<br />\n<br />\nGettysburg<br />\nHarris<br />\nO'Brien<br />\nPure<br />\nSaphs<br />\nBriber<br />\n<br />\nVol<br />\n<br />\nof whom thumped the Jays this<br />\nFall, two new tough ones\u2014Susquehanna and Hampden-Sydney\u2014<br />\nhave--been added to the slate, replacing PMC and Washington<br />\nCollege.<br />\n'<br />\n<br />\nThe administration has taken exception with the views expressed<br />\nin that column and offers this new slant on athletic policy:<br />\nHopkins does not have and does not *ant a .reputation for<br />\n\"de-emphasis.\" According to Director of Admissions William Logan,<br />\nhe and Dean Shaffer have been trying since the war to kill the theory<br />\nthat Hopkins is \"different\", that it is inot interested in athletics.<br />\nThis idea grew up during the pre-war days of real de-emphasis, when<br />\nHopkins teams were improperly equipped, uniformed, and coached.<br />\nJHU students, ashamed of their athletic squads, tried to ignore them<br />\nand concentrated their attentions on other activities, giving birth to<br />\nthe \"difference.\"<br />\nThe administration now feels that gitod athletic teams are an<br />\n...important part of any school's morale and for that reason they are<br />\nanxious to find athletes with the scholastic qualifications to do Hopkins<br />\nwork.<br />\nThis does not mean that a program of athletic scholarships as<br />\nsuch is now in force or will ever be. It does mean,-however, that<br />\ncertain steps can be taken to insure that at least a minimum of<br />\nathletes show-up at Homewood.<br />\nThese steps are:<br />\n1. It is easier for an athlete ito obtain one of the Hopkins open<br />\nscholarships titan it is for a non-athlete: That is, if two boys are competing for a scholarship\u2014one who writes for his sehool.paper and<br />\ncomplies a 13+ high school average, and anether olin plays football<br />\nand basketball and conies up with a B or I3\u2014 average, then the<br />\nathlete will get the tree ride.<br />\n<br />\nIn addition to Hopkins, other<br />\nThis doesn't mean that,woodcarving majors from local industrial<br />\nschools admitted were: Brooklyn<br />\nCollege, Queens College, West Vir- schools who possess an acute perception for snaring forward passes<br />\nginia U, Ithaca College, Clarkson will be handed scholarships\u2014good grades rentain the basis for all<br />\nTech, Hobart, Drexel Tech, FAM, scholarship grants.<br />\nand RPI.<br />\n4.2.. Howdy Myers and other Hopkins coaches are being given a<br />\nfreer hand in dealing with high school players and coaches in their<br />\nefforts to interest athletes in coming this way.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n3. An attempt will be made in the future to organize the local<br />\nand out-of-town alumni and the H-Club into effective units for selling<br />\nHopkins to high school students. The H-Club is more than willing to<br />\nget in on such programs and is just waiting for the green light.<br />\n<br />\nWrestlers Flip Hens;2641<br />\nGrapple 1171th 117trginia<br />\n<br />\nCoach George Wackenhut's Blue Jay wrestling team made it known officially last Saturday<br />\neve that they were a squad to be reckoned with this year.<br />\nLiving up to pre-season reports, they came through with a resounding victory over Delaware<br />\nU, 26 to 8.<br />\nThe Jay matmen swept through the first six weight brackets with Lee Kent, Guy Cromwell, Bud Potter, Harry Tighe, Bill Armiger, and Ernie Leipold blanking their respective foes in<br />\nrapid-fire order.<br />\nHowever, 175-pounder Howie<br />\nGoodrich lost on a fall in the second period, and Walt Lapinski,<br />\nwrestling under a decided weight<br />\ndisadvantage in the heavyweight<br />\nclass, was outpointed by Delaware<br />\ncaptain Ted Youngling.<br />\nTonight, down in Dixie, Southern hospitality will go by the<br />\nboards as the Virginia wrestlers<br />\nplay host to the Jays.

Once athletesstre here at Homewood, every effort will be made<br />\nto build up close coach-student-faculty relationships. This doesn't<br />\nmean \"gut\" courses and few semester hours for athletes\u2014it does mean<br />\nthat the boy will be convinced that people are interested in itim and<br />\nhis ability to do his work and stay at Hopkins.<br />\nIt is the feeling that this program, particularly the part dealing<br />\nwith a tight organization of alumni and H-Club and other undergraduates, can, without the athletic acholarship, attract enough good<br />\nathletes to Hopkins to enable the school to compete with worthwhile<br />\nteams\u2014Army, Princeton and the rest of the Big Five in lacrosse, and<br />\nDickinson, Western Maryland, etc., in football..<br />\nThe open presentation of these facts amazed the News-Letter<br />\nand probably will come as a shock to many of its readers. Some.<br />\nquarters have already expressed doubt that the school really plans<br />\nto operate along these lines. However, the News-Letter is willing ,to<br />\nbury the term \"de-emphasis\" and never resurrect it if these claims<br />\nare true.<br />\nWe agree that this plan is ideal and that it can work. Hopkins<br />\nhas a good enough academic name that she can afford to offer a little<br />\nless than her competition and still get her share of athletes. If the<br />\nAdmissions Office will follow through on this plan, Hopkins shouldn't<br />\nhave to scan the elementary school system for future athletic foes.<br />\nIt is true, however, that the best Hopkins scholarship offers only<br />\ntuition, while the best scholarships at most of our athletic competitors<br />\nInclude room and board:<br />\nThe alumni have indicated that they are willing to splend more<br />\nthan their time to aid Hopkins' in obtaining worthwhile boys\u2014some<br />\nof them will also part with some cash towards the same ends. Here,<br />\nthen, is where this cash could best be put to use.<br />\nIn cases where a boy has been passed through the Admissions<br />\n-office and has been granted a tuition scholarship, but is skeptical<br />\nabout Hopkins because another school is -offering him tuition, room,<br />\nand board, the alumni could jump in and offer to pay his room and<br />\nboard costs at JHU.

Popularly, nylon is said to be made from<br />\ncoal, air and water. This is because<br />\noriginally, in developing its chemical intermediates,chemists used benzene (from coal), ammonia (from air<br />\nand water), and oxygen (from air).<br />\nBut Du Pont is alivays looking for<br />\nnew ways of doing things. After the<br />\ndiscovery of nylon in 1934, research<br />\nmen immediately began looking for<br />\nalternative ways of making the two<br />\nmain intermediates\u2014 adipic acid and<br />\nhexamethylenediamine. In 1935,<br />\nwhen nylon was still in the laboratory stage and three years before its<br />\ncommercial debut,they started work<br />\non the. possibility of using furfural<br />\nin the process.<br /><br />\ncyanide available for converting the<br />\n1,4-dichlorobutane into adiponitrile.<br /><br />\nThis is an excellent example of the<br />\ninteresting work in industrial organic<br />\nchemistry carried on at Du Pont. It<br />\nrequired the technical knowledge and<br />\n'skill of highly trained research and<br />\ndevelopment men, including organic<br />\nand physical chemists; chemical, mechanical, civil and electrical engineers, and others.<br />\nC. R. Dewey, B. S. Chem., Niagara University, 1941, and J. M. Estes, B.S. Ch.E., University of Missouri, 1937, engaged in production of adiponitrile at the Du Pont Elextrochemicals plant in Niagara Falls, New York.<br /><br />\n14 Years of Research<br />\nand Development<br />\nIt seems a far cry from corncobs to<br />\nnylon, and it was. The development<br />\nfrom the first small-scale laboratory<br />\nexperiments to the present full-scale<br />\nplant cost 14 years of time and about<br />\nfive million dollars. But it enabled<br />\nchemists to produce large quantities<br />\nof adiponitrile, the compound from<br />\nwhich hexamethylenediamine is<br />\nmade, by an economical process<br />\nwhich uses natural materials that<br />\nare in continuous supply.<br />\nIn the new process,furfural is converted by a series of steps to 1,4-dichlorobutane.

The general campus<br />\nopinion was that JHU was pioneering iu the field of \"de-emphasis\"\u2014<br />\nthat the Admissions officers would take an athlete with good grades<br />\nif he applied, but that they wouldn't bother to go around the corner<br />\nto find one.<br /><br />\nSquad.<br />\nFor 36 minutes of last Friday<br />\nnight's 50-45 loss to Wagner, the<br />\ncagers' debut under Bilgrav was<br /><br />\nGettysburg<br />\nHarris<br />\nO'Brien<br />\nPure<br />\nSaphs<br />\nBriber<br /><br />\nVol<br /><br />\nof whom thumped the Jays this<br />\nFall, two new tough ones\u2014Susquehanna and Hampden-Sydney\u2014<br />\nhave--been added to the slate, replacing PMC and Washington<br />\nCollege.<br />\n'<br /><br />\nThe administration has taken exception with the views expressed<br />\nin that column and offers this new slant on athletic policy:<br />\nHopkins does not have and does not *ant a .reputation for<br />\n\"de-emphasis.\" According to Director of Admissions William Logan,<br />\nhe and Dean Shaffer have been trying since the war to kill the theory<br />\nthat Hopkins is \"different\", that it is inot interested in athletics.<br />\nThis idea grew up during the pre-war days of real de-emphasis, when<br />\nHopkins teams were improperly equipped, uniformed, and coached.<br />\nJHU students, ashamed of their athletic squads, tried to ignore them<br />\nand concentrated their attentions on other activities, giving birth to<br />\nthe \"difference.\"<br />\nThe administration now feels that gitod athletic teams are an<br />\n...important part of any school's morale and for that reason they are<br />\nanxious to find athletes with the scholastic qualifications to do Hopkins<br />\nwork.<br />\nThis does not mean that a program of athletic scholarships as<br />\nsuch is now in force or will ever be. It does mean,-however, that<br />\ncertain steps can be taken to insure that at least a minimum of<br />\nathletes show-up at Homewood.<br />\nThese steps are:<br />\n1. It is easier for an athlete ito obtain one of the Hopkins open<br />\nscholarships titan it is for a non-athlete: That is, if two boys are competing for a scholarship\u2014one who writes for his sehool.paper and<br />\ncomplies a 13+ high school average, and anether olin plays football<br />\nand basketball and conies up with a B or I3\u2014 average, then the<br />\nathlete will get the tree ride.<br /><br />\nIn addition to Hopkins, other<br />\nThis doesn't mean that,woodcarving majors from local industrial<br />\nschools admitted were: Brooklyn<br />\nCollege, Queens College, West Vir- schools who possess an acute perception for snaring forward passes<br />\nginia U, Ithaca College, Clarkson will be handed scholarships\u2014good grades rentain the basis for all<br />\nTech, Hobart, Drexel Tech, FAM, scholarship grants.<br />\nand RPI.<br />\n4.2.. Howdy Myers and other Hopkins coaches are being given a<br />\nfreer hand in dealing with high school players and coaches in their<br />\nefforts to interest athletes in coming this way.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n3. An attempt will be made in the future to organize the local<br />\nand out-of-town alumni and the H-Club into effective units for selling<br />\nHopkins to high school students. The H-Club is more than willing to<br />\nget in on such programs and is just waiting for the green light.<br /><br />\nWrestlers Flip Hens;2641<br />\nGrapple 1171th 117trginia<br /><br />\nCoach George Wackenhut's Blue Jay wrestling team made it known officially last Saturday<br />\neve that they were a squad to be reckoned with this year.<br />\nLiving up to pre-season reports, they came through with a resounding victory over Delaware<br />\nU, 26 to 8.<br />\nThe Jay matmen swept through the first six weight brackets with Lee Kent, Guy Cromwell, Bud Potter, Harry Tighe, Bill Armiger, and Ernie Leipold blanking their respective foes in<br />\nrapid-fire order.<br />\nHowever, 175-pounder Howie<br />\nGoodrich lost on a fall in the second period, and Walt Lapinski,<br />\nwrestling under a decided weight<br />\ndisadvantage in the heavyweight<br />\nclass, was outpointed by Delaware<br />\ncaptain Ted Youngling.<br />\nTonight, down in Dixie, Southern hospitality will go by the<br />\nboards as the Virginia wrestlers<br />\nplay host to the Jays.

Once athletesstre here at Homewood, every effort will be made<br />\nto build up close coach-student-faculty relationships. This doesn't<br />\nmean \"gut\" courses and few semester hours for athletes\u2014it does mean<br />\nthat the boy will be convinced that people are interested in itim and<br />\nhis ability to do his work and stay at Hopkins.<br />\nIt is the feeling that this program, particularly the part dealing<br />\nwith a tight organization of alumni and H-Club and other undergraduates, can, without the athletic acholarship, attract enough good<br />\nathletes to Hopkins to enable the school to compete with worthwhile<br />\nteams\u2014Army, Princeton and the rest of the Big Five in lacrosse, and<br />\nDickinson, Western Maryland, etc., in football..<br />\nThe open presentation of these facts amazed the News-Letter<br />\nand probably will come as a shock to many of its readers. Some.<br />\nquarters have already expressed doubt that the school really plans<br />\nto operate along these lines. However, the News-Letter is willing ,to<br />\nbury the term \"de-emphasis\" and never resurrect it if these claims<br />\nare true.<br />\nWe agree that this plan is ideal and that it can work. Hopkins<br />\nhas a good enough academic name that she can afford to offer a little<br />\nless than her competition and still get her share of athletes. If the<br />\nAdmissions Office will follow through on this plan, Hopkins shouldn't<br />\nhave to scan the elementary school system for future athletic foes.<br />\nIt is true, however, that the best Hopkins scholarship offers only<br />\ntuition, while the best scholarships at most of our athletic competitors<br />\nInclude room and board:<br />\nThe alumni have indicated that they are willing to splend more<br />\nthan their time to aid Hopkins' in obtaining worthwhile boys\u2014some<br />\nof them will also part with some cash towards the same ends. Here,<br />\nthen, is where this cash could best be put to use.<br />\nIn cases where a boy has been passed through the Admissions<br />\n-office and has been granted a tuition scholarship, but is skeptical<br />\nabout Hopkins because another school is -offering him tuition, room,<br />\nand board, the alumni could jump in and offer to pay his room and<br />\nboard costs at JHU. The school has stated that they have no complaint- -against' this practice\u2014in fact, it has been done in isolated cases in<br />\nthe past.<br /><br />\n\u2014Picture be lititierhoff<br />\nWrestling captain IF R E D 1) I E<br />\nby an arm injury, Smith will miss his second<br />\nstraight meet tonight when the<br />\nJays trek to Virginia.<br /><br />\nsmunt\u2014Hampered<br /><br />\nIf the alumni is really interested in seeing-Hopkins maintain a<br />\nposition with some prestige in the field of intercollegiate pthletics<br />\nand not return to the pitiful days of the late '30s, when former AliAmerican lacrosse greats were ashamed to admit that they had gone<br />\nto Hopkins because of the sad state of its athletic program, here is<br />\ntheir opportunity.<br /><br />\nFr<br /><br />\nT'<br />\nt<br />\nthe<br /><br />\nTI<br />\nFro:<br />\nto<br />\nChai<br />\neven]<br />\n13<br />\nourf<br />\nopti,<br />\nhop,<br />\nwon<br /><br />\nups<br />\n!rah<br /><br />\nV.<br /><br />\nF4<br /><br />\n*owl<br /><br />\nviam<br /><br />\nUnit<br /><br />\nan (<br /><br />\nStud<br />\n10<br /><br />\npole<br /><br />\nbull<br /><br />\ndenc<br />\nset<br /><br />\nIwo<br /><br />\nPt<br /><br />\ngosh<br /><br />\nlater<br /><br />\nmusl<br /><br />\nlug<br /><br />\nBE<br /><br />\nflee I<br /><br />\nvote:<br />\nBorn<br /><br />\ntitle<br />\nlast<br />\nman<br />\nthe 1<br />\nNen<br />\nthat<br />\nDon<br />\ncan<br /><br />\n13:<br />\nday,<br />\nsije<br />\ncount<br />\nelect<br />\nflout<br />\nThe<br />\nthe<br />\nNew!<br /><br />\n1(<br /><br />\nCon<br /><br />\nOf<br />\nthe<br />\n!Mite<br />\nleg u<br /><br />\nBe<br />\n4110MI<br />\ndents<br />\ngeom<br />\nphito<br />\nfail<br /><br />\nSA\u2022<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 39422, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "b2556157-ff23-4bab-995c-34c1f56a4e50", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/13527-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 13527, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "fb62633e-b5f2-4b44-8288-5d9c816ebbfd", "url": "/node/13527"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "aad87f93-5eac-48ed-8ae9-71edd94c7f87"}]}
