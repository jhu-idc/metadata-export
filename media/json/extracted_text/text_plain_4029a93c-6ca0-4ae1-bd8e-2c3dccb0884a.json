D. a Chinese emperor instiAtuted<br />\nthe first known competitive examina-<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\ntions. They were in literary and historical<br />\nsubjects, and the degrees given enabled their<br />\npossesors to enter the civil service. As a result,<br />\nto-day the great body of educated men in the<br />\nmost immense nation on earth are pursuing<br />\nclassical studies, which lead toward degrees<br />\ncorresponding to our A. B., Ph. D., etc., conferring the right to go into politics; and these<br />\ndegrees are obtained by undergoing a course of<br />\ntests before which the most fearsome college<br />\nexaminations seem child's-play.<br />\nThese great systems of government examinations for literary degrees are most important<br />\nto every educated Chinaman. For the degrees<br />\nare the only passports to public office; and to<br />\nget into politics is the earnest aim and hope of<br />\nevery literary Chinaman.<br />\nThis is quite<br />\nnatural. From an Oriental's point of view,<br />\ngovernment positions are most valuable, both<br />\nsocially and financially. An imperial representative, in any of the nine ranks, enjoys<br />\npersonal immunity, and belongs to the only<br />\naristocracy of the land, that of education.<br />\nMoreover, the tremendous network of provincial government affords unexcelled opportunities for bribery and extortion. It is the<br />\npopular opinion that officers of the government<br />\ngenerally squeeze out of their positions about<br />\nten times the lawful salary. Under these<br />\nattractive conditions, it is small wonder that<br />\ncandidates flock by thousands to the towns<br />\nwhere the trials are conducted.<br />\n<br />\nNo. 15.<br />\n<br />\nIt is not known how many of the applicants<br />\nhave attended the colleges and high schools.<br />\nA large number of them are prepared by tutors.<br />\nFor all the test is alike; even the National<br />\nCollege at Pekin, the highest institution of<br />\nthe empire, confers no privileges on its<br />\ngraduates.<br />\nFour successive degrees may be won. The<br />\nfirst signifies \"flowering talent,\" and has been<br />\ntranslated \"bachelor of arts.\" It is conferred<br />\nat the provincial capitals. Each province of<br />\nthe empire is divided into departments, and<br />\nthese are subdivided into districts. A triple<br />\nseries of examinations is held; the best men in<br />\neach district go up to the chief town of the<br />\ndepartment, and the best men in each department proceed to the capital of the province.<br />\nTo these finals not more than one-tenth of the<br />\nfirst applicants succeed. In 1832, 4000 men<br />\ncame up for the first trial from twc: districts<br />\naggregating 1,500,000 population. Out of<br />\nthese 4000 only thirteen in one district, and<br />\nfourteen in the other, passed the first series.<br />\nA \"bachelor\" can be a great man in his<br />\nnative town. He is enrolled among the \"gentry,\" and his social position is assured. He is<br />\nexempt from corporal punishment. He can<br />\nbe a magistrate, or the head man of the village.<br />\nAnd if he wishes to go on, he is eligible for<br />\nthe next examination.<br />\nThe second degree, that of \"promoted men,\"<br />\nis bestowed triennially at the 18 provincial<br />\ncapitals. The examinations are very useful<br />\nin weeding out the bachelors and separating<br />\nthem into \"students\" and \"officers,\" since<br />\nbachelors' degrees are sometimes procured by<br />\nbribery and influence.<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nThe examining hall at Canton will serve as<br />\na specimen. It contains 7500 cells, furnished<br />\nsimply with two boards, one for sitting, the<br />\nother for writing. These cells are arranged<br />\naround a number of open courts, so that constant watch may be kept over the students.<br />\nThis is no idle form. Miniature editions of<br />\nthe classics and MS. essays are quite often<br />\nsecreted by the applicants, in spite of the most<br />\ncareful searching, which extends to each man's<br />\nwadded clothes and inkstand, or round lump<br />\nof sulphate of iron.<br />\nPenalties for this method of cheating the<br />\nprofessor are grotesquely severe, including the<br />\npunishment of the offender's father and tutor.<br />\nAmong the Chinese, indeed, there is absolutely no idea of the \"honor system.\" A<br />\ncandidate who is caught breaking the rules is<br />\nexpelled from the examinations, and his name<br />\nis \"pasted out\" on the main door; yet he turns<br />\nup again for the next trials with apparently<br />\nunimpaired standing.<br />\nThe students, shut up in these tiny cells,<br />\nreceive on the first day essay themes from the<br />\nFour Chinese Books, on the second day subjects from the Five Classics, and on the last<br />\nday<br />\n. topics concerning doubtful points of government. The first of these Five Classics<br />\ndates back to 1150 B. C. The Four Books are<br />\ncomparatively modern. They were edited<br />\nabout moo A. D. These ancient books of<br />\nwisdom are the mainstay of all Chinese literature and government. They contain innumerable philosophic sayings, thousands of which<br />\neach student must know by heart. For in<br />\nthis, as in all other examinations, the best man<br />\nis he who can write from memory the greatest<br />\nnumber of Confucian maxims, who can most<br />\nclosely imitate the terse style of the sages, and<br />\nwho can turn out the largest quantity of polished verse in a given time.<br />\nThe mental exercise of handling about thirteen such essay themes in three days' time can<br />\nbe well appreciated by any college Senior.<br />\nThe Chinese students, moreover, are bothered<br />\nby the smoke of the cooking around them,<br />\nenervated by the excessive September heat,<br />\ncramped and numbed by the long confinement<br />\n<br />\nin their narrow cells, measuring 3x4 feet, in<br />\nwhich there is no room to lie down. They<br />\noften become insane; many of them die outright. Especially is this the case with the old<br />\nmen who flunk year after year, but keep trying.<br />\nIn sonic instances, father, son, and grandson<br />\nhave been taking the same examination at the<br />\nsame time. When an old gray-head succumbs<br />\nto the awful strain, his body is shoved through<br />\na hole in the wall, left to the pity of his<br />\nfriends.<br />\nDifferent is the reception that awaits the<br />\nvictors\u2014those who live and succeed. There<br />\nare sonic 70 or 8o of them, out of 5,000 to<br />\no,000 applicants, in each province. They are<br />\nbanqueted with great pomp by the governors,<br />\ncommissioners and high officials; their names<br />\nare posted in a public place, while the governor bows, and salutes are fired. Offices are<br />\nopen to those who wish them. The others are<br />\nready to take the next examination.<br />\nThe board of examiners, meanwhile, are<br />\nhaving their own troubles. There are ten<br />\nmen; they are allowed twenty-five days for<br />\ntheir work, and they have to select the 70 or<br />\n8o best out of from 50,000 to 75,000 papers on<br />\na dozen subjects. This might average about<br />\n260 essays a day for each examiner. The<br />\nmarking system, too, is closely watched by<br />\nthe students ; any impartiality or error is<br />\nliable to raise a storm of protest, and the examiners must steer carefully to avoid irritating<br />\nthe graduates. The utmost rigidity, however,<br />\nis customary in marking the papers. One<br />\nabbreviation of a character has condemned an<br />\nessay.<br />\nThose \"promoted men\" who do not at once<br />\ntake office may try for the third, or \"doctor's\"<br />\ndegree. The examinations are held triennially<br />\nat Pekin. Each test lets through from 150 to<br />\n400 \"doctors.\" The three honor men receive rewards from the Emperor himself; and<br />\noffices of all kind, civil and literary, are ready<br />\nfor those who have passed the third degree.<br />\nThe fourth and highest distinction is more<br />\nan office than a degree; for those who attain<br />\nit become members of the Imperial Academy,<br />\nand receive salaries. The examination is at<br />\n<br />\n:.:\u2022\u202211111<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nthe Emperor's palace, before the greatest personages of the empire; and the degree is one<br />\nof the highest honors that can be bestowed<br />\nupon a Chinaman.<br />\nIn this manner, beginning with an examination in the little district village, and finally<br />\nmounting to the court of the Son of Heaven<br />\nhimself, a Chinaman of literary ability can<br />\nhold the most splendid offices and ranks in the<br />\nempire. The system has its faults: it allows<br />\ncheating, bribery, impersonations, the forging<br />\nof diplomas. But it consistently hammers at<br />\nthe theory that the man must be fit for the<br />\noffice. In this respect the Chinese system of<br />\nexaminations has no parallel in any past or<br />\npresent government.<br />\nfir or sr<br />\nA LIKENESS OF PROFESSOR FRANCIS<br />\nJ. CHILD.<br />\nmany days ago a medallion likeness of<br />\nNOT<br />\nProfessor Francis J. Child, of Harvard<br />\nUniversity, was presented to the Johns Hopkins University by Dr. Howard A. Kelly,<br />\nProfessor in the Medical School. The likeness<br />\nis in bronze, and was modelled by Miss Lelia<br />\nM. Usher, of Boston. It is an excellent work<br />\nand brings vividly to mind the characteristics<br />\nof the man whom it portrays.<br />\nThe advanced students of English, with<br />\nsome of the instructors and a few friends,<br />\nassembled to review the life of Professor Child<br />\nand to bring to mind his various contributions<br />\nto the study of English literature and philology.<br />\nThree papers were presented by members of<br />\nthe English Seminary, namely: by R. D. Miller, on the \"Life and Character of Professor<br />\nChild;\" by George D. Brown, on \"Professor<br />\nChilds Investigations of Chaucer's L a n guage;\" by L. Wardlaw Miles, on \"Professor<br />\nChild's Studies of English and Scottish Ballads.\"<br />\nProfessor Green, who had been a pupil of<br />\nProfessor Child, also gave some personal reminiscences, and other speakers who were present contributed.to the interest of the occasion<br />\nby brief remarks.<br />\nIt is not generally known that at the open-<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\ning of this University Professor Child was<br />\ninvited to come here as Professor of English.<br />\nHe was strongly tempted to accept, but certain<br />\nchanges were made in his relations to Harvard<br />\nwhich lessened his duties there, and he at<br />\nlength declined the overtures from Baltimore.<br />\nSome passages of his letter are still of interest:<br />\n\"As I told you, a large salary is a consideration that my circumstances will not allow me<br />\nto make light of. The liberal plan of your<br />\nUniversity presents attractions which are at<br />\nleast equal to the better salary. You see,<br />\ntherefore, that I do not find it easy to decline<br />\nthe honor which you offer me. If you will<br />\ntake off one half my years and the obligations<br />\nto other people which I have incurred in them,'<br />\nI will accept your proposition with delight.\"<br />\nWhen it was found that he could not come<br />\nas a permanent professor, he was invited to<br />\ncome as a lecturer, and this he did for two<br />\nsuccessive years. In the first year he lectured<br />\nupon Chaucer; in the second, upon \"Ballads;\"<br />\nand he gave a supplementary course of lectures<br />\nupon Shakespeare.<br />\n<br />\nTHEIR CHOICES.<br />\n'oz Co-ed: \"I prefer a senior\u2014a man with a<br />\npast.\"<br />\nCo-ed: \"Oh, I prefer a freshman, a man<br />\nwith a future.\"<br />\n'03 Co-ed: (Who is expecting a ring,) \"And<br />\nI prefer a sophomore--a man with a present.\"<br />\n\u2014California Occident.<br />\n<br />\nWhen a maiden meets a maiden<br />\nIn a place apart,<br />\nThey together whisper softly,<br />\nTalking heart to heart.<br />\nWhen a fellow meets a maiden<br />\n(Take a little tip)<br />\nHe prefers the conversation<br />\nTo be lip to lip.<br />\n\u2014Tiger.<br />\n<br />\n\f4<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\ntbe Ilews.letter.<br />\n<br />\nPublished Fortnightly during the University Year by the<br />\nStudents of THE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY.<br />\n<br />\nMAY 16, 1901.<br />\nSubscription $1.50 per year.<br />\n<br />\nEditor in Chief, . . .<br />\nAssociate Editor in Chief,<br />\nNews Editor, .<br />\nAssistant News Editors, .<br />\nAthletic Editors,<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\nBusiness Manager,<br />\n.<br />\nAssistant Business Manager,<br />\n<br />\nto cents a single copy.<br />\n<br />\nWILLIAM B, HILL, 1902,<br />\nSOL STROUSE, 1902.<br />\n. .

Naturally it is a disappointment, a<br />\nbitter disappointment, to every son of \"old<br />\nTommy Hopkins\" to witness such a finale<br />\nafter the most brilliant lacrosse season we have<br />\never had, but no fault can be found with our<br />\nmen for the result. They did their best; no<br />\nmore could be asked. Swathmore played a<br />\nbetter game, and\u2014won. Starting the season<br />\nwith men such as McInnes and Maddren out<br />\nof the game, the Hopkins lacrosse team<br />\nshowed how machine-like team work could<br />\nbe developed, and the result was an attack<br />\nwhich, taken as a unit, has never been surpassed, if equalled here.<br />\nThree of the hardest games of the season<br />\nwithin eight days, was a fearful strain on our<br />\nmen ; but, after it is over, it is useless to speculate upon what the results might have been<br />\nif circumstances had been different. \"The<br />\n<br />\nLord loveth whom he chasteneth;\" so, after<br />\nall, the lesson may not be altogether devoid of<br />\nbeneficial results. At all events we have a<br />\nteam to be proud of, and Captain Tyler and<br />\nhis men are to be congratulated for their season's work.<br />\nor w<br />\nOW that the Hullabaloo elections are over,<br />\nand an editorial staff representative of the<br />\nclass of 1902 has been chosen to edit next<br />\nyear's book, it is only fair to say that while<br />\nthese men will doubtless exert every effort to<br />\nmake their publication a success, a great deal<br />\nof this success depends upon the rest of the<br />\nclass. It must be borne in mind that the<br />\nHullabaloo is not a creation of some dozen men<br />\nwho have been honored by being chosen to<br />\nedit it, but a product of the entire class. Remember, every Junior is an integral part of<br />\nthe class of 1902, and next year's Hullabaloo<br />\nis the official publication of that class, in which<br />\nevery member should feel a vital interest.<br />\nThis interest will be made much stronger by a<br />\ncontribution of your talent to the book. Bear<br />\nthis in mind during the coming vacation, and<br />\ndevote some of your spare moments to writing<br />\nsomething for your class book. During the<br />\nnext scholastic year, be on the alert for interesting items that will help to swell its pages.<br />\nIf the interest of each member of the class can<br />\nbe sufficiently aroused for them to take this<br />\nsmall amount of trouble, THE NEWS-LETTER<br />\npredicts that next year's Hullabaloo will be the<br />\nbest ever published at the University.<br />\nwww<br />\nAMONG the innovations which THE NliwsLETTER hopes to introduce next year is<br />\nan increase of illustrations in its pages. It has<br />\nlong been felt that one of the best features of<br />\na college paper\u2014artistic illustrations\u2014should,<br />\nif possible, appear in THE NEWS-LETTER, and<br />\nit is the intention of the board of editors to try<br />\nto render such a thing possible. As the first<br />\nthing necessary for the success of the proposed<br />\n<br />\nN<br />\n<br />\n\f5<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nmove is a capable artistic staff of one or more<br />\ninen, we desire to awake the interest of all<br />\nJuniors and Freshmen by a competitive contest. The present cover of THE NEWSLETTER<br />\nhas seen service now for over a year, and<br />\nthough it is still appropriate, we think that<br />\nour first issue next year should be clad in a<br />\n\u2022different garb. Therefore, let all men who<br />\nhave any artistic ability try to benefit both the<br />\npaper and themselves by drawing a new cover<br />\ndesign, which is to be ready at the beginning<br />\nof the term in October. Something in a poster<br />\neffect in two colors\u2014black and blue, is preferred, though we do not desire to place any<br />\nlimitations on the design. Further information can be had by referring to the editors.<br />\n<br />\nbeen taken seriously by some readers of this<br />\npaper. It was intended only as an exaggerated account of a mere trifle, and we are sorry<br />\nif we failed to make this perfectly clear.

Up to<br />\nher defeat here, the record of the Crimson has<br />\nbeen a brilliant one, and the success of the<br />\nHopkins men in white-washing them was a<br />\nmost gratifying surprise. Both teams put up<br />\nan excellent game, and the representatives of<br />\nthe Black and Blue fairly outdid themselves.<br />\nIn all points Hopkins outclassed Harvard, and<br />\nher success is well merited.

Much of the<br />\ncredit for this fast scoring is due to the<br />\nHopkins coaches and Captain. Tyler. After a<br />\nmost careful study of the past games with<br />\nHarvard it was decided that Hopkins must<br />\n\"get in the game\" from the start. So they<br />\ndid, and the two goals were the reward of this<br />\ntimely advice. Before the half had ended the<br />\nboys in Black and Blue had put the ball two<br />\nmore times in the net and had a good lead in<br />\nthe men from Cambridge. The Crimson defense was good; their attack was better, as our<br />\nboys learned in the second half; but by clever<br />\nwork Briscoe turned aside several shotA which<br />\nseemed good, with the result that Harvard<br />\nhad to be content with not scoring.<br />\nThe play of Wynne, Howards \"Canuck\"<br />\nat Cover Point and Guggenheimer, Hopkins<br />\nold goal tend was quite noticeable, and drew<br />\nfrequent applause from the thousand people<br />\nwho eagerly watched every play from the<br />\ngrand stand.<br />\nThe line up of the teams was as follows:<br />\nJOHNS HOPKINS.<br />\n<br />\nBriscoe<br />\nSchmeisser<br />\nMaddren<br />\nStraus<br />\nBruton<br />\nTyler<br />\nAbercrombie<br />\nP.

In a very short time, however, the<br />\nswift, lightning team work and excellent tipping of our men brought the ball with a rush<br />\nthrough the Swarthmore defense to B. Bernheim, who shot the first goal of the game. It<br />\ntook hardly any time after the change of goals<br />\nfor the ball to pass again through our attack<br />\nto J.

The.one important thing now, is for the men to hold<br />\ntogether until the St. John's game, which is<br />\nthe only championship game we will play,<br />\nsince Western Maryland forfeited their game<br />\nwith us. The team needs all the practice it<br />\ncan get until this game, and must keep up<br />\nenthusiasm, and stick it out to the finish.

It is positively known that<br />\nthe University of Maryland entered two ineligible men in the relay races, in which the<br />\nHopkins track team competed, at Philadelphia. The names of these men are Rullman<br />\nand Rolph. The former was captain of the<br />\nSt. John's track team at the time of the games<br />\ngiven under the auspices of the J. H. U., at<br />\nthe Fifth Regiment armory, and was recently<br />\nexpelled from St. John's; therefore was disqualified to enter the relay races at Philadelphia, under the regulations which governed<br />\nthe entries.<br />\nThe particular regulation referred to, states<br />\nthat \"No one shall represent any college or<br />\nuniversity, as a competitor, who has not been<br />\na member of that college or university, in good<br />\nand regular standing, from the fifteenth of the<br />\npreceding October.\" Rolph's name is not to be<br />\nfound either on the attendance list, or the<br />\nbooks of the Treasurer of the University of<br />\nMaryland, and if he had been eligible to run<br />\nunder the conditions stated in above regulation, his name would have been easily found.<br />\nAs to Rullman, to imagine him captain of the<br />\nSt. John's track team and, at the same time, a<br />\nmember of the University of Maryland from<br />\nthe preceding October, is absurd. Blome was.<br />\nalso taken to Philadelphia, as a substitute on<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\nthe University of Maryland track team.<br />\nNeither was his name to be found on the attendance list, or the Treasurer's books.<br />\nIt seems that the ineligibility of these men<br />\nwas known before they entered the races, but<br />\nas the University of Maryland ran so poorly,<br />\nfinishing last in every relay, it was decided<br />\nnot to push the protest. It is probably too<br />\nlate now to enforce the protest, but the facts<br />\nof the case should not be passed over, without<br />\nbeing known; therefore THE NEWS-LETTER<br />\ntakes the present opportunity of publishing<br />\nthis \"breach of good faith\" which the University of Maryland has evidently been<br />\nguilty of.<br />\nGreat care has always been taken to keep<br />\nathletics at Hopkins on the \"dead level,\" and<br />\nit is hoped that all underhand business by<br />\ninstitutions with whom we compete will be<br />\ndetected and exposed in the future, as it has<br />\nbeen in the past.<br />\n<br />\nUNIVERSITY NEWS NOTES.<br />\nand Mrs. Joseph Ames have taken<br />\nDOCTOR<br />\na cottage for the summer at Chattolanee.<br />\norgy-.<br />\nDr. and Mrs. Basil Gildersleeve will spend<br />\nthe summer at Magnolia, Mass.<br />\nAs .as<br />\nDr. Renouf has entirely recovered from the<br />\ninjuries received as the result of a fall from<br />\nhis wheel.<br />\n<br />\nWW<br />\nProf. Gildersleeve will be the Hopkins delegate to the Yale celebration of next October.<br />\nProf. Remsen has been chosen as alternate_<br />\nWW<br />\n<br />\nA number of men who will be graduated by<br />\nthe Medical School this year have already<br />\nreceived appointments in the leading hospitals<br />\nof the North. \"Billy\" Maddren will go to<br />\nKings County Hospital, Brooklyn.<br />\nw or or<br />\nProf. Paul Haupt will spend the summer<br />\nabroad.

You may be pretty sure that<br />\nwhen this thing keeps up for fourteen years<br />\nthere must be a magnet of some kind drawing<br />\nhard, that either they or their friends have<br />\nbeen there before and had a good time. Further, you may guess that these men will not<br />\nlet go this chance to come into close touch<br />\nwith one another in friendly rivalry and intercourse. The Northfield Conferences are primarily religious gatherings; the men who<br />\ncome there are for the most part Christian<br />\nmen; there are a good many meetings of a distinctly religious character, addressed by leading Christian speakers and writers from all<br />\nover the world. And in consequence, the principal effect that these Conferences have on a<br />\nman is not that on his social nature, nor his<br />\nphysical make up, nor his brain. A man's<br />\nspiritual being is given a stimulus and is deepened in a most unusual way. The large colleges send crowds of men to Northfield every<br />\nyear; last year Yale had over a hundred delegates. These fellows are the cream of their<br />\ninstitutions, and many a man who has been at<br />\nNorthfield looks back to it as the starting<br />\npoint for a life-long friendship of the truest<br />\nsort.<br />\nThis year the management of the Conference has made arrangements with some of the<br />\nablest speakers to address the meetings.

For the degrees<br />\nare the only passports to public office; and to<br />\nget into politics is the earnest aim and hope of<br />\nevery literary Chinaman.<br />\nThis is quite<br />\nnatural. From an Oriental's point of view,<br />\ngovernment positions are most valuable, both<br />\nsocially and financially. An imperial representative, in any of the nine ranks, enjoys<br />\npersonal immunity, and belongs to the only<br />\naristocracy of the land, that of education.<br />\nMoreover, the tremendous network of provincial government affords unexcelled opportunities for bribery and extortion. It is the<br />\npopular opinion that officers of the government<br />\ngenerally squeeze out of their positions about<br />\nten times the lawful salary. Under these<br />\nattractive conditions, it is small wonder that<br />\ncandidates flock by thousands to the towns<br />\nwhere the trials are conducted.<br /><br />\nNo. 15.<br /><br />\nIt is not known how many of the applicants<br />\nhave attended the colleges and high schools.<br />\nA large number of them are prepared by tutors.<br />\nFor all the test is alike; even the National<br />\nCollege at Pekin, the highest institution of<br />\nthe empire, confers no privileges on its<br />\ngraduates.<br />\nFour successive degrees may be won. The<br />\nfirst signifies \"flowering talent,\" and has been<br />\ntranslated \"bachelor of arts.\" It is conferred<br />\nat the provincial capitals. Each province of<br />\nthe empire is divided into departments, and<br />\nthese are subdivided into districts. A triple<br />\nseries of examinations is held; the best men in<br />\neach district go up to the chief town of the<br />\ndepartment, and the best men in each department proceed to the capital of the province.<br />\nTo these finals not more than one-tenth of the<br />\nfirst applicants succeed. In 1832, 4000 men<br />\ncame up for the first trial from twc: districts<br />\naggregating 1,500,000 population. Out of<br />\nthese 4000 only thirteen in one district, and<br />\nfourteen in the other, passed the first series.<br />\nA \"bachelor\" can be a great man in his<br />\nnative town. He is enrolled among the \"gentry,\" and his social position is assured. He is<br />\nexempt from corporal punishment. He can<br />\nbe a magistrate, or the head man of the village.<br />\nAnd if he wishes to go on, he is eligible for<br />\nthe next examination.<br />\nThe second degree, that of \"promoted men,\"<br />\nis bestowed triennially at the 18 provincial<br />\ncapitals. The examinations are very useful<br />\nin weeding out the bachelors and separating<br />\nthem into \"students\" and \"officers,\" since<br />\nbachelors' degrees are sometimes procured by<br />\nbribery and influence.<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nThe examining hall at Canton will serve as<br />\na specimen. It contains 7500 cells, furnished<br />\nsimply with two boards, one for sitting, the<br />\nother for writing. These cells are arranged<br />\naround a number of open courts, so that constant watch may be kept over the students.<br />\nThis is no idle form. Miniature editions of<br />\nthe classics and MS. essays are quite often<br />\nsecreted by the applicants, in spite of the most<br />\ncareful searching, which extends to each man's<br />\nwadded clothes and inkstand, or round lump<br />\nof sulphate of iron.<br />\nPenalties for this method of cheating the<br />\nprofessor are grotesquely severe, including the<br />\npunishment of the offender's father and tutor.<br />\nAmong the Chinese, indeed, there is absolutely no idea of the \"honor system.\" A<br />\ncandidate who is caught breaking the rules is<br />\nexpelled from the examinations, and his name<br />\nis \"pasted out\" on the main door; yet he turns<br />\nup again for the next trials with apparently<br />\nunimpaired standing.<br />\nThe students, shut up in these tiny cells,<br />\nreceive on the first day essay themes from the<br />\nFour Chinese Books, on the second day subjects from the Five Classics, and on the last<br />\nday<br />\n. topics concerning doubtful points of government. The first of these Five Classics<br />\ndates back to 1150 B. C. The Four Books are<br />\ncomparatively modern. They were edited<br />\nabout moo A. D. These ancient books of<br />\nwisdom are the mainstay of all Chinese literature and government. They contain innumerable philosophic sayings, thousands of which<br />\neach student must know by heart. For in<br />\nthis, as in all other examinations, the best man<br />\nis he who can write from memory the greatest<br />\nnumber of Confucian maxims, who can most<br />\nclosely imitate the terse style of the sages, and<br />\nwho can turn out the largest quantity of polished verse in a given time.<br />\nThe mental exercise of handling about thirteen such essay themes in three days' time can<br />\nbe well appreciated by any college Senior.<br />\nThe Chinese students, moreover, are bothered<br />\nby the smoke of the cooking around them,<br />\nenervated by the excessive September heat,<br />\ncramped and numbed by the long confinement<br /><br />\nin their narrow cells, measuring 3x4 feet, in<br />\nwhich there is no room to lie down. They<br />\noften become insane; many of them die outright. Especially is this the case with the old<br />\nmen who flunk year after year, but keep trying.<br />\nIn sonic instances, father, son, and grandson<br />\nhave been taking the same examination at the<br />\nsame time. When an old gray-head succumbs<br />\nto the awful strain, his body is shoved through<br />\na hole in the wall, left to the pity of his<br />\nfriends.<br />\nDifferent is the reception that awaits the<br />\nvictors\u2014those who live and succeed. There<br />\nare sonic 70 or 8o of them, out of 5,000 to<br />\no,000 applicants, in each province. They are<br />\nbanqueted with great pomp by the governors,<br />\ncommissioners and high officials; their names<br />\nare posted in a public place, while the governor bows, and salutes are fired. Offices are<br />\nopen to those who wish them. The others are<br />\nready to take the next examination.<br />\nThe board of examiners, meanwhile, are<br />\nhaving their own troubles. There are ten<br />\nmen; they are allowed twenty-five days for<br />\ntheir work, and they have to select the 70 or<br />\n8o best out of from 50,000 to 75,000 papers on<br />\na dozen subjects. This might average about<br />\n260 essays a day for each examiner. The<br />\nmarking system, too, is closely watched by<br />\nthe students ; any impartiality or error is<br />\nliable to raise a storm of protest, and the examiners must steer carefully to avoid irritating<br />\nthe graduates. The utmost rigidity, however,<br />\nis customary in marking the papers. One<br />\nabbreviation of a character has condemned an<br />\nessay.<br />\nThose \"promoted men\" who do not at once<br />\ntake office may try for the third, or \"doctor's\"<br />\ndegree.

The system has its faults: it allows<br />\ncheating, bribery, impersonations, the forging<br />\nof diplomas. But it consistently hammers at<br />\nthe theory that the man must be fit for the<br />\noffice.

Naturally it is a disappointment, a<br />\nbitter disappointment, to every son of \"old<br />\nTommy Hopkins\" to witness such a finale<br />\nafter the most brilliant lacrosse season we have<br />\never had, but no fault can be found with our<br />\nmen for the result. They did their best; no<br />\nmore could be asked. Swathmore played a<br />\nbetter game, and\u2014won. Starting the season<br />\nwith men such as McInnes and Maddren out<br />\nof the game, the Hopkins lacrosse team<br />\nshowed how machine-like team work could<br />\nbe developed, and the result was an attack<br />\nwhich, taken as a unit, has never been surpassed, if equalled here.<br />\nThree of the hardest games of the season<br />\nwithin eight days, was a fearful strain on our<br />\nmen ; but, after it is over, it is useless to speculate upon what the results might have been<br />\nif circumstances had been different. \"The<br /><br />\nLord loveth whom he chasteneth;\" so, after<br />\nall, the lesson may not be altogether devoid of<br />\nbeneficial results.

It must be borne in mind that the<br />\nHullabaloo is not a creation of some dozen men<br />\nwho have been honored by being chosen to<br />\nedit it, but a product of the entire class. Remember, every Junior is an integral part of<br />\nthe class of 1902, and next year's Hullabaloo<br />\nis the official publication of that class, in which<br />\nevery member should feel a vital interest.<br />\nThis interest will be made much stronger by a<br />\ncontribution of your talent to the book.

During the<br />\nnext scholastic year, be on the alert for interesting items that will help to swell its pages.<br />\nIf the interest of each member of the class can<br />\nbe sufficiently aroused for them to take this<br />\nsmall amount of trouble, THE NEWS-LETTER<br />\npredicts that next year's Hullabaloo will be the<br />\nbest ever published at the University.<br />\nwww<br />\nAMONG the innovations which THE NliwsLETTER hopes to introduce next year is<br />\nan increase of illustrations in its pages. It has<br />\nlong been felt that one of the best features of<br />\na college paper\u2014artistic illustrations\u2014should,<br />\nif possible, appear in THE NEWS-LETTER, and<br />\nit is the intention of the board of editors to try<br />\nto render such a thing possible.

Up to<br />\nher defeat here, the record of the Crimson has<br />\nbeen a brilliant one, and the success of the<br />\nHopkins men in white-washing them was a<br />\nmost gratifying surprise.

Much of the<br />\ncredit for this fast scoring is due to the<br />\nHopkins coaches and Captain. Tyler. After a<br />\nmost careful study of the past games with<br />\nHarvard it was decided that Hopkins must<br />\n\"get in the game\" from the start. So they<br />\ndid, and the two goals were the reward of this<br />\ntimely advice. Before the half had ended the<br />\nboys in Black and Blue had put the ball two<br />\nmore times in the net and had a good lead in<br />\nthe men from Cambridge.

In a very short time, however, the<br />\nswift, lightning team work and excellent tipping of our men brought the ball with a rush<br />\nthrough the Swarthmore defense to B.

This being<br />\na preliminary game, no wonders were expected, and none were developed. The Hopkins<br />\nteam made as good showing as could be expected with its late start and small amount of<br />\npractice. Baker's pitching was the most noticeable feature of the game. He succeeded in<br />\nstriking out fifteen of the Rock Hill men,<br />\nallowing only one clean hit.<br />\nThe fielding on our side was rather poor,<br />\nbut the men ran the bases well, and hit Rock<br />\nHill's pitcher at will, one half of the first<br />\ninning being a regular\"batting matinee.\"<br />\nThe visitors fielded fairly well, making two<br />\npretty double plays, but showed up poorly<br />\nwith the stick, getting but one hit and three<br />\n\"scratches.\"<br />\nPINAL RESULT.<br /><br />\nHopkins<br />\nRock Hill<br /><br />\nR.<br /><br />\nH.<br /><br />\nE.<br /><br />\n17<br /><br />\n13<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\n5<br />\n4<br /><br />\nWWW<br /><br />\nGEORGETOWN, 21.<br /><br />\nHOPKINS, 2.<br /><br />\nHopkins was simply outclassed Saturday<br />\nafternoon.

The.one important thing now, is for the men to hold<br />\ntogether until the St. John's game, which is<br />\nthe only championship game we will play,<br />\nsince Western Maryland forfeited their game<br />\nwith us. The team needs all the practice it<br />\ncan get until this game, and must keep up<br />\nenthusiasm, and stick it out to the finish. All<br />\nwho can should now concentrate their utmost<br />\nefforts in the welfare of our baseball team.<br /><br />\nPURE ATHLETICS.<br />\nmore does the question of Pure Atho NCE<br />\nAthletics present itself to the notice of<br />\nthe student body. It is positively known that<br />\nthe University of Maryland entered two ineligible men in the relay races, in which the<br />\nHopkins track team competed, at Philadelphia. The names of these men are Rullman<br />\nand Rolph. The former was captain of the<br />\nSt. John's track team at the time of the games<br />\ngiven under the auspices of the J. H. U., at<br />\nthe Fifth Regiment armory, and was recently<br />\nexpelled from St. John's; therefore was disqualified to enter the relay races at Philadelphia, under the regulations which governed<br />\nthe entries.<br />\nThe particular regulation referred to, states<br />\nthat \"No one shall represent any college or<br />\nuniversity, as a competitor, who has not been<br />\na member of that college or university, in good<br />\nand regular standing, from the fifteenth of the<br />\npreceding October.\" Rolph's name is not to be<br />\nfound either on the attendance list, or the<br />\nbooks of the Treasurer of the University of<br />\nMaryland, and if he had been eligible to run<br />\nunder the conditions stated in above regulation, his name would have been easily found.<br />\nAs to Rullman, to imagine him captain of the<br />\nSt. John's track team and, at the same time, a<br />\nmember of the University of Maryland from<br />\nthe preceding October, is absurd. Blome was.<br />\nalso taken to Philadelphia, as a substitute on<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\nthe University of Maryland track team.<br />\nNeither was his name to be found on the attendance list, or the Treasurer's books.<br />\nIt seems that the ineligibility of these men<br />\nwas known before they entered the races, but<br />\nas the University of Maryland ran so poorly,<br />\nfinishing last in every relay, it was decided<br />\nnot to push the protest. It is probably too<br />\nlate now to enforce the protest, but the facts<br />\nof the case should not be passed over, without<br />\nbeing known; therefore THE NEWS-LETTER<br />\ntakes the present opportunity of publishing<br />\nthis \"breach of good faith\" which the University of Maryland has evidently been<br />\nguilty of.<br />\nGreat care has always been taken to keep<br />\nathletics at Hopkins on the \"dead level,\" and<br />\nit is hoped that all underhand business by<br />\ninstitutions with whom we compete will be<br />\ndetected and exposed in the future, as it has<br />\nbeen in the past.<br /><br />\nUNIVERSITY NEWS NOTES.<br />\nand Mrs. Joseph Ames have taken<br />\nDOCTOR<br />\na cottage for the summer at Chattolanee.<br />\norgy-.<br />\nDr. and Mrs. Basil Gildersleeve will spend<br />\nthe summer at Magnolia, Mass.<br />\nAs .as<br />\nDr. Renouf has entirely recovered from the<br />\ninjuries received as the result of a fall from<br />\nhis wheel.<br /><br />\nWW<br />\nProf. Gildersleeve will be the Hopkins delegate to the Yale celebration of next October.<br />\nProf. Remsen has been chosen as alternate_<br />\nWW<br /><br />\nA number of men who will be graduated by<br />\nthe Medical School this year have already<br />\nreceived appointments in the leading hospitals<br />\nof the North. \"Billy\" Maddren will go to<br />\nKings County Hospital, Brooklyn.<br />\nw or or<br />\nProf. Paul Haupt will spend the summer<br />\nabroad.

You may be pretty sure that<br />\nwhen this thing keeps up for fourteen years<br />\nthere must be a magnet of some kind drawing<br />\nhard, that either they or their friends have<br />\nbeen there before and had a good time. Further, you may guess that these men will not<br />\nlet go this chance to come into close touch<br />\nwith one another in friendly rivalry and intercourse. The Northfield Conferences are primarily religious gatherings; the men who<br />\ncome there are for the most part Christian<br />\nmen; there are a good many meetings of a distinctly religious character, addressed by leading Christian speakers and writers from all<br />\nover the world. And in consequence, the principal effect that these Conferences have on a<br />\nman is not that on his social nature, nor his<br />\nphysical make up, nor his brain. A man's<br />\nspiritual being is given a stimulus and is deepened in a most unusual way. The large colleges send crowds of men to Northfield every<br />\nyear; last year Yale had over a hundred delegates. These fellows are the cream of their<br />\ninstitutions, and many a man who has been at<br />\nNorthfield looks back to it as the starting<br />\npoint for a life-long friendship of the truest<br />\nsort.<br />\nThis year the management of the Conference has made arrangements with some of the<br />\nablest speakers to address the meetings. President Seth Low of Columbia, Dr. Alexander<br />\nMackenzie of Harvard, Dr. Maltbie D. Babcock, and then Mr. Mott and Mr. Speer, are<br />\nto be on hand for the Conference.<br />\nHopkins sent ten men last year, and the<br />\nprospects are that during the ten days of the<br />\nConference this summer, from June 27th to<br />\nJuly 8th, we shall have at least 15 at the camp.<br />\nMr. A.
