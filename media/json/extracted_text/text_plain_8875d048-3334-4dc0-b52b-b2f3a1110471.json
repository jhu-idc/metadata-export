What is behind the<br />\nwhole situation from either the Jays' or<br />\nJohnnies' viewpoint is a matter of conjecture and mystery.<br />\nSomething must be done to prevent<br />\nthe breach from widening. Something<br />\nmust be done to prevent the seemingly<br />\ninevitable severing of athletic relations<br />\nbetween J. H. U. and St. John's College.<br />\nThere is no doubt that the student bodies<br />\nof each college do not want the curtailment of these relations. Then, where does<br />\nthe trouble lie? That's a question which<br />\nmust be answered by the Hopkins athletic mogul, Mr. Henry Iddins.<br />\nTomorrow, the Jays and Johnnies<br />\nclash on the football gridiron in what is<br />\neither the first or second game for each<br />\nteam this season. Will this annual classic,<br />\nwhich at one of the night games last<br />\nyear drew one of the largest Homewood<br />\ncrowds on record, draw the same, or<br />\nnearly the same, number of spectators at<br />\nsuch an early date on the schedule of the<br />\ntwo elevens? No matter what the athletic powers at Homewood may say\u2014<br />\nfor publication\u2014we honestly believe that<br />\nthe attendance will not reach the record<br />\nof 5,000 spectators, which number puts<br />\nenough cash in the coffers of the two<br />\nschools to defray a part of the expenses<br />\nfor the season.<br />\nHow can football enthusiasm for a<br />\ngame between two such ancient rivals as<br />\nHopkins and St. John's be aroused to<br />\nthe point where it should be in a week<br />\nor two? It is a known fact that both<br />\nthe Jays and the Johnnies have the<br />\nyearly urge to beat each other in the<br />\ngridiron sport, if not any other team.<br />\nThe annual clash should, without a doubt,<br />\nbe placed near the conclusion of the<br />\nschedule to serve as a sort of climax to<br />\nthe season. Of course, we admit that<br />\nthere may be unrevealed details which<br />\nmay have forced the game to be played<br />\nright at the beginning of the 1932 season.<br />\nWe ask the Hopkins athletic authorities<br />\nto give its reasons for the situation.

Certainly, congratulations are due William<br />\nTriplett, president of the Council, for<br />\nthis intelligent, wise action which will<br />\nclip the wings of class officers and committees who make it their aim to use the<br />\ncash collected for class dues for personal<br />\nbenefits.<br />\nThere is not the slightest reason for<br />\nthe squandering of class treasuries by<br />\nofficers and committeemen. As it is, it is<br />\ndifficult for the students to pay the dues<br />\neach year. In the past freshmen and<br />\nsophomores, especially, have been actually robbed of their money because it<br />\nhas been the practice of the class moguls<br />\nto recklessly and carelessly use funds<br />\navailable to them on banquets which<br />\nshould cost only one-half of the amount<br />\nrequested. It is a known fact that as<br />\nmuch as $90 has been handed out for<br />\ngasoline expenses for banquet season ac:tivities.<br />\nWith the view in mind of stopping such<br />\npractices, Student Council has passed the<br />\nnew ruling which is outlined in an article<br />\nelsewhere in this issue. We believe that<br />\nit will be carried out successfully. We<br />\nhave a great deal of faith in Mr. Triplett and his associates.<br />\nNeedless to say, the success of the<br />\nplan will insure a reduction in the highly<br />\nexorbitant Senior Class dues, which last<br />\nyear were $25.<br />\nTo elaborate, we may explain that<br />\nstatement in this manner. Assume that<br />\nthe Freshman Class dues amount to $400.<br />\nUnder the new regulations, the expense<br />\nof the freshman banquet in April will<br />\ndoubtless be cut tremendously. Suppose,<br />\nthen, that there remains a balance of<br />\n$200 at the end of the year. That money<br />\nis turned over, assume, to the Sophomore Class, whose dues amount to $350.<br />\nAs a consequence, the total bank balance<br />\nof the second year group will reach $750.<br />\nThe sophomores, suppose, use $250 for<br />\nits banquet. The balance, then, of $500<br />\nis turned over to the Junior Class, whose<br />\ndues amount, we'll say, to $300. That<br />\nbrings the total to $800. Of that amount<br />\n$350 is used for the Prom in April. The<br />\n$450 balance is transferred to the Senior<br />\nClass. With that money available and<br />\nwith approximate figures on the cost of<br />\nJune Week and the printing of the Hullabaloo, a way can be found to reduce<br />\nthe dues of each senior.<br />\nIt is undeniable that the Hullabaloo<br />\ncan obtain more than $3,500 on advertising in the yearbook. The cost of publishing the annual should not exceed<br />\n$4,500. The class, in that case, would<br />\nshoulder the additional $1,000 expense.<br />\nAt $20 for Senior Class dues a sum of<br />\nabout $3,500 could be raised on the campus. Putting only $1,000 toward the yearbook, the class could thus have about<br />\n$2,500 for use on June Week. Additional<br />\nfunds are made available by the sale of<br />\ntickets to outsiders for the Senior Ball,<br />\nat which, usually, a nationally known<br />\norchestra plays.<br />\n<br />\nCONSCIENTIOUS, a diligent<br />\nworker, a good student, and an extremely likeable person are the terms<br />\nwhich best describe William H.<br />\nTriplett, president of Student Council for 1932-33.<br />\nBILL has the makings of a good<br />\nexecutive and there's no doubt that<br />\nhe'll make himself one of the best<br />\nStudent Council presidents there<br />\nhas ever been at the Johns Hopkins.<br />\nHe's well-grounded in student government work, for Bill has been a<br />\nmember of the Student Council sit-ice<br />\nhis freshman year.

The student<br />\nbody is not at all 'Council-conscious.'<br />\nStudents regard it as a joke, a 'flop',<br />\na protection against strict faculty<br />\nsupervision. The Council's job is<br />\nto make them understand the seriousness of getting caught at cheating and the usually extreme penalty<br />\ndemanded by the Council upon<br />\nconviction\u2014expulsion. The undergraduates, as a whole, rarely hear of<br />\nthe fairly numerous expulsions for<br />\ncheating during the college year.<br />\n\"My opinion, then, is to attempt<br />\nto make students respect the Council and its decisions rather than to<br />\nattemPt to rely on and appeal to<br />\ntheir honor and decency, as gentlemen. That stuff doesn't go at<br />\nHopkins. It is also the duty of the<br />\nCouncil, I believe, to prevent any<br />\ntemptations and any conditions<br />\nwhich may encourage cheating.<br />\nPresents Suggestions<br />\n<br />\n\"Several ways in which the<br />\nstudent governing body might discourage infractions of the honor<br />\nsystem are: (1) to publish in THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER details, minus names<br />\nof offenders, of cases in which undergraduates are found guilty of<br />\nviolations; (2) keep all students in<br />\nrooms assigned them throughout the<br />\nexam period (which will prevent<br />\nchances and temptations to cheat;<br />\nphysical necessities must, then, be<br />\ntaken care of finally before the<br />\nexam is taken) ; (3) instill more<br />\nthoroughly in the students, by assemblies and by announcements<br />\nprior to exams, the principles of and<br />\npenalties for violations of the honor<br />\nsystem; (4) influence all students<br />\nto warn, if not actually report, all<br />\nmen seen breaking the honor system.<br />\nNearly Complete Failure<br />\n<br />\n\"The indifference toward the<br />\nhonor system at present is due to<br />\nits nearly complete failure in the<br />\npast two years. Until the Council<br />\ntakes strong measures to improve<br />\nitself and conditions existing, the<br />\nindifference will continue, as will<br />\nthe failure of the Council.\"<br />\n<br />\nHandbook Omission<br />\nCorrected By Editor<br />\nThe editor of the Y.

Mulberry St.<br /><br />\nFRIDAY, OCTOBER<br /><br />\n7, 1932<br /><br />\nSt. John's And Hopkins<br />\nOFFICIALS of either St. John's or<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins cannot readily deny<br />\nthat the athletic relations between the<br />\ntwo institutions are annually becoming<br />\nmore and more strained and that the athletic breach between the two is becoming<br />\ndangerously wider. What is behind the<br />\nwhole situation from either the Jays' or<br />\nJohnnies' viewpoint is a matter of conjecture and mystery.<br />\nSomething must be done to prevent<br />\nthe breach from widening. Something<br />\nmust be done to prevent the seemingly<br />\ninevitable severing of athletic relations<br />\nbetween J. H. U. and St. John's College.<br />\nThere is no doubt that the student bodies<br />\nof each college do not want the curtailment of these relations. Then, where does<br />\nthe trouble lie? That's a question which<br />\nmust be answered by the Hopkins athletic mogul, Mr. Henry Iddins.<br />\nTomorrow, the Jays and Johnnies<br />\nclash on the football gridiron in what is<br />\neither the first or second game for each<br />\nteam this season. Will this annual classic,<br />\nwhich at one of the night games last<br />\nyear drew one of the largest Homewood<br />\ncrowds on record, draw the same, or<br />\nnearly the same, number of spectators at<br />\nsuch an early date on the schedule of the<br />\ntwo elevens? No matter what the athletic powers at Homewood may say\u2014<br />\nfor publication\u2014we honestly believe that<br />\nthe attendance will not reach the record<br />\nof 5,000 spectators, which number puts<br />\nenough cash in the coffers of the two<br />\nschools to defray a part of the expenses<br />\nfor the season.<br />\nHow can football enthusiasm for a<br />\ngame between two such ancient rivals as<br />\nHopkins and St. John's be aroused to<br />\nthe point where it should be in a week<br />\nor two? It is a known fact that both<br />\nthe Jays and the Johnnies have the<br />\nyearly urge to beat each other in the<br />\ngridiron sport, if not any other team.<br />\nThe annual clash should, without a doubt,<br />\nbe placed near the conclusion of the<br />\nschedule to serve as a sort of climax to<br />\nthe season. Of course, we admit that<br />\nthere may be unrevealed details which<br />\nmay have forced the game to be played<br />\nright at the beginning of the 1932 season.<br />\nWe ask the Hopkins athletic authorities<br />\nto give its reasons for the situation. We<br />\nask this in the interests of the student<br />\nbody and alumni.<br />\nThe gun was fired in lacrosse in 1931<br />\nwhen St. John's did everything, for reasons known only to the Annapolis institution, to prevent a stick contest between<br />\nthe two teams. Two dates, April 18 and<br />\n25, were given St. John's, but both were<br />\nAs a consequence, Hopkins<br />\nrejected.<br />\nThen,<br />\nscheduled two other twelves.<br />\ntentatively, May 2 was offered to the<br />\nbalking Crabtowners. The Annapolitans<br />\naccepted the date, knowing that on May<br />\n1 Hopkins met Princeton. But J. H. U.<br />\nauthorities declared the two successive<br />\ngames \"a physical impossibility.\" June<br />\n6 was suggested. The new Johnny excuse was \"it will be after commencement.\" To top it all, Todie Riggs, St.<br />\nJohn's athletic director, was quoted in<br />\nthe Annapolis Evening Capital in April,<br />\n1931, as having said he was \"much<br />\naroused over Hopkins's indifferent attitude\"!

Certainly, congratulations are due William<br />\nTriplett, president of the Council, for<br />\nthis intelligent, wise action which will<br />\nclip the wings of class officers and committees who make it their aim to use the<br />\ncash collected for class dues for personal<br />\nbenefits.<br />\nThere is not the slightest reason for<br />\nthe squandering of class treasuries by<br />\nofficers and committeemen. As it is, it is<br />\ndifficult for the students to pay the dues<br />\neach year. In the past freshmen and<br />\nsophomores, especially, have been actually robbed of their money because it<br />\nhas been the practice of the class moguls<br />\nto recklessly and carelessly use funds<br />\navailable to them on banquets which<br />\nshould cost only one-half of the amount<br />\nrequested. It is a known fact that as<br />\nmuch as $90 has been handed out for<br />\ngasoline expenses for banquet season ac:tivities.<br />\nWith the view in mind of stopping such<br />\npractices, Student Council has passed the<br />\nnew ruling which is outlined in an article<br />\nelsewhere in this issue. We believe that<br />\nit will be carried out successfully. We<br />\nhave a great deal of faith in Mr. Triplett and his associates.<br />\nNeedless to say, the success of the<br />\nplan will insure a reduction in the highly<br />\nexorbitant Senior Class dues, which last<br />\nyear were $25.<br />\nTo elaborate, we may explain that<br />\nstatement in this manner. Assume that<br />\nthe Freshman Class dues amount to $400.<br />\nUnder the new regulations, the expense<br />\nof the freshman banquet in April will<br />\ndoubtless be cut tremendously. Suppose,<br />\nthen, that there remains a balance of<br />\n$200 at the end of the year. That money<br />\nis turned over, assume, to the Sophomore Class, whose dues amount to $350.<br />\nAs a consequence, the total bank balance<br />\nof the second year group will reach $750.<br />\nThe sophomores, suppose, use $250 for<br />\nits banquet. The balance, then, of $500<br />\nis turned over to the Junior Class, whose<br />\ndues amount, we'll say, to $300. That<br />\nbrings the total to $800. Of that amount<br />\n$350 is used for the Prom in April. The<br />\n$450 balance is transferred to the Senior<br />\nClass. With that money available and<br />\nwith approximate figures on the cost of<br />\nJune Week and the printing of the Hullabaloo, a way can be found to reduce<br />\nthe dues of each senior.<br />\nIt is undeniable that the Hullabaloo<br />\ncan obtain more than $3,500 on advertising in the yearbook. The cost of publishing the annual should not exceed<br />\n$4,500. The class, in that case, would<br />\nshoulder the additional $1,000 expense.<br />\nAt $20 for Senior Class dues a sum of<br />\nabout $3,500 could be raised on the campus. Putting only $1,000 toward the yearbook, the class could thus have about<br />\n$2,500 for use on June Week. Additional<br />\nfunds are made available by the sale of<br />\ntickets to outsiders for the Senior Ball,<br />\nat which, usually, a nationally known<br />\norchestra plays.<br /><br />\nCONSCIENTIOUS, a diligent<br />\nworker, a good student, and an extremely likeable person are the terms<br />\nwhich best describe William H.<br />\nTriplett, president of Student Council for 1932-33.<br />\nBILL has the makings of a good<br />\nexecutive and there's no doubt that<br />\nhe'll make himself one of the best<br />\nStudent Council presidents there<br />\nhas ever been at the Johns Hopkins.<br />\nHe's well-grounded in student government work, for Bill has been a<br />\nmember of the Student Council sit-ice<br />\nhis freshman year. If what he has<br />\ndone during this first week of the<br />\ncurrent college year is indicative of<br />\nhis ability, Triplett may be expected<br />\nto make many wise changes in the<br />\nundergraduate school.<br />\nTHE Council president is a student in the College of Arts and Sciences and is preparing himself for<br />\nthe study of law.<br />\nTHE fact that both the Alumni<br />\nand the Varsity Club scholarships<br />\nhave been awarded to him, shows<br />\nthat Bill is also a good student.<br />\nHe came to the University from<br />\nthe local high school, Baltimore<br />\nCity College, a good athlete.

It is also the duty of the<br />\nCouncil, I believe, to prevent any<br />\ntemptations and any conditions<br />\nwhich may encourage cheating.<br />\nPresents Suggestions<br /><br />\n\"Several ways in which the<br />\nstudent governing body might discourage infractions of the honor<br />\nsystem are: (1) to publish in THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER details, minus names<br />\nof offenders, of cases in which undergraduates are found guilty of<br />\nviolations; (2) keep all students in<br />\nrooms assigned them throughout the<br />\nexam period (which will prevent<br />\nchances and temptations to cheat;<br />\nphysical necessities must, then, be<br />\ntaken care of finally before the<br />\nexam is taken) ; (3) instill more<br />\nthoroughly in the students, by assemblies and by announcements<br />\nprior to exams, the principles of and<br />\npenalties for violations of the honor<br />\nsystem; (4) influence all students<br />\nto warn, if not actually report, all<br />\nmen seen breaking the honor system.<br />\nNearly Complete Failure<br /><br />\n\"The indifference toward the<br />\nhonor system at present is due to<br />\nits nearly complete failure in the<br />\npast two years. Until the Council<br />\ntakes strong measures to improve<br />\nitself and conditions existing, the<br />\nindifference will continue, as will<br />\nthe failure of the Council.\"<br /><br />\nHandbook Omission<br />\nCorrected By Editor<br />\nThe editor of the Y.
