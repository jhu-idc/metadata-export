It is this relationship<br />\nwith his students I would like to<br />\ndwell upon briefly.<br />\nIt is a well-known fact that as a<br />\nteacher Dr. Ames has always stood<br />\nin the first ranks of that profession.<br />\nDr. Ames was a very serious lecturer and demanded the undivided attention of his students, objecting to<br />\nany notes beTfig made by the students while he was teaching. He liked<br />\nto have the eyes of the students and<br />\nthey soon found out that it was well<br />\nto keep their brains working as well,<br />\nfor Dr. Ames seemed to know when<br />\na mind began to wander, and would<br />\npounce upon the wanderer with a<br />\nquestion which would bring him back<br />\nand keep him alert.<br />\nIn the early days he had but one<br />\ncopy of his lectures, carefully written up, and left upon his desk for<br />\nthe use of his students while writing<br />\nup the lecture to which they had just<br />\nlistened, but in later years mimeographed copies of his lectures were<br />\ndistributed among his students, to<br />\ntheir delight.<br />\nDr. Ames was at all times available to his students.

It was not an unusual thing<br />\nfor a graduate student to become disgusted with himself during the first<br />\nfew weeks of his residence in the<br />\nUniversity. He felt he knew so little,<br />\nthe lectures were all above his head<br />\nand he could never hope to reach up<br />\nto them.

For that<br />\nreason I feel like reserving my own<br />\nto his consideration in one particular<br />\naspect: as a reader of books in general, and as an encourager of general reading.<br />\nI remember once hearing Dr. Ames<br />\ndeclare that the real test of a man's<br />\neducation is what he does with his<br />\nleisure. From his own wide knowledge of all sorts of books outside of<br />\nhis special field, one might suppose<br />\nhe spends all his leisure reading.<br />\nAgain and again I have heard some<br />\nbook, old or recent, mentioned in his<br />\npresence, and have heard him show<br />\nunmistakable\u2014faimmediate\u2014and<br />\nmiliarity with its contents. How does<br />\nhe do it? I should suggest that he<br />\nspends both leisure and working<br />\nhours in reading, but what he has<br />\ndone in travel, aviation, science, and<br />\nadministration renders this theory<br />\ndoubtful.<br />\nMost people draw such a long face<br />\nwhen education is mentioned.
