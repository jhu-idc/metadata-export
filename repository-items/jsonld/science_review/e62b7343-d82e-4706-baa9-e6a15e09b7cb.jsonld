        "@value": "Lynn Poole sets the scene of Shays' Rebellion in 1787 Massachusetts, and American history professor Charles Barker, with the assistance of costumed actors, fills in the details. This first political protest after the American Revolution was a precursor of Jacksonian democracy and led to the creation of the U.S. Constitution. At issue were the farmers caught between mounting debts and insufficient gold-backed paper currency in circulation. In numerous towns in western Massachusetts, such as Northampton, Worcester, Great Barrington, armed mobs prevented the supreme judicial courts from sitting and sending debtors to prison. They were led by Capt. Daniel Shays, a veteran of the Revolution and farmer from Pelham, MA. Gen. Lincoln's army was sent to suppress the insurrections and protect the judicial courts. On January 25, 1787, Shays' rebels attacked the arsenal at Springfield, MA, but were rebuffed by Gen. Shepard's troops. With the exception of two, the rebels were pardoned after asking forgiveness, and the government made the reforms they sought. Dr. Barker recommends two books about the incident: George Richard Minot's famous \"History of the Insurrections in Massachusetts\" and the historical fiction \"Duke of Stockbridge\" by Edward Bellamy."
