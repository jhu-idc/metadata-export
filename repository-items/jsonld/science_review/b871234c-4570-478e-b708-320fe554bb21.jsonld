        "@value": "Librarian James Dickson of the Enoch Pratt Free Library in Baltimore, Maryland, displays library resources that supplement the books: magazines, documents, maps, 16mm films, phonograph records, sheet music, pamphlets, microfilm, and pictures. Director Amy Winslow heads a staff of 472 working in Pratt's main library, 27 branches, and 2 mobile units. A film shows and describes professional librarians performing various duties, a page boy's activities, the circulation desk with photographic charger, the ready reference desk, catalogers, acquisitions, preparations department, print shop, children's department, art studio, and branch library functions. Mr. Dickson tells Lynn Poole that he's a librarian because he likes to help people, to exercise his resourcefulness, and to perform worthwhile social work. He says the qualifications of a good librarian should include curiosity, orderliness, enjoyment and understanding of books, good eyesight, and \"well-sprung arches.\" The Johns Hopkins University librarian, John Berthel, broadly explains his duties and the appeal of working in a large research library. He says that many of the job qualifications are the same as those for a public librarian but also adds interest in one or more subject fields, knowledge of foreign languages, business management skills, good judgment, and a sense of humor. Mr. Dickson notes that the education requirements to become a librarian include a college degree in liberal arts and a year of graduate library training. Mr. Berthel points out that there are four groups of libraries: public, college and research, elementary and secondary, and industrial or business. Prospects for jobs in librarianship, including part-time work for high school or college students, are good as educational institutions increase."
