In 1900 only sixteen kinds of metal were used by American industry, but at the time of this program, there are 321 known metals and alloys. Lynn Poole shows a piece of a new metal, Fiberfrax, that doesn't get hot when heated. Dr. Maddin, associate professor of metallurgy at Johns Hopkins University, discusses the inside of metal and shows a model of atoms in a perfect metal and one with deviations or imperfections. Mr. Poole notes that only 460 metallurgists are being trained in 45 colleges each year but at least three times that number are needed each year for the next ten years. Dr. Hollomon, head of the metallurgy and ceramic research division of General Electric (GE), lists common metal products and discusses how metals, such as titanium alloys, must be made stronger to withstand the higher temperatures occurring at faster jet speeds and to solve the problem of fractured pipelines and ships. There are career opportunities for chemist metallurgists, involving ingots and arch melting; process metallurgists, researching the forces in metals; development metallurgists, testing stresses and corrosion of metals; and research metallurgists, looking inside metals. Dr. Hollomon recommends studying math, physics, and chemistry in high school to begin the path to becoming a metallurgist.

Willis Gore, Johns Hopkins University assistant professor of electrical engineering, points out that an engineer both creates or invents and operates what he has produced. He uses a servosystem to demonstrate two branches of electric engineering: communications (electronics) and power (generation and utilization of power). Thomas Trice, superintendent of electrical operations of Baltimore Gas and Electric, says that electrical engineering has emerged as a leading profession as electrical demand has increased dramatically since 1910. A film of the electrical planning process stresses reliability of service, safety, and cost of a design. An electrical power analyzer is shown and explained as are meters and relays designed for accuracy and dependability at the Herbert A. Wagner electric generating station in Baltimore. Another film follows the generation of electricity from the coal pile through an electrical power plant and over wires to various customers. George Bisset, senior vice president of Potomac Electric Power Co. in Washington, DC, discusses the shortage of electrical engineers, noting that atomic energy will not replace electrical energy, and that use will at least double every ten years.

Dr. Iler, research manager of the Grasselli Chemical Dept. at E. I. duPont de Nemours and Co., defines chemistry and chemical reactions and lists everyday products created from chemical reactions. In agriculture, fertilizers, insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, and feed supplements for livestock and poultry are all chemical creations. The process to develop a new product involves organic chemists; physical chemists; analytical chemists; biologists; chemical, mechanical, and electrical engineers; and often soil chemists and biochemists. A film shows how research results applied to farm production result in greater output with less labor. The goal of agricultural research chemists is to create new knowledge, processes, and products, and improve present ones, for plants and animals. Dr. Iler notes that 90% of all chemicals tested are inadequate. He then explains the steps required to test a new fungicide chemical, beginning with making the chemicals easily mixable with water for spraying on plants and ending with analysis of the resulting fruit with a colorimeter to test for chemical absorption. He also briefly comments on chemicals in cattle dips and sprays to control insects and parasites on livestock. Dr. Iler says that curiosity, a background in math and sciences, and a college degree are necessities to become a chemist or chemical engineer. Mr. Poole makes available the booklet ""Chemistry and the Farmer"" for a postcard.",62cfdefb-9b9a-4039-980b-ef8048fb0c1b,bb3ea708-ba7c-47c7-81e7-e6041d1a11c8,,b13a7bd3-36ed-4838-a661-d2edd4c7924e,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Tomorrow on May 28, 1955 from the studios of WAAM in Baltimore, Md.

This applies to the actuary's responsibility of underwriting life insurance for people with hazardous jobs or high health risks.

Dr. Kelso Morrill, an associate professor of math at Johns Hopkins University, describes pure mathematics as the ability to think logically in abstract terms, but one also needs patience, enthusiasm, and creativity to teach it. He explains and compares the decimal and binary systems of counting.

Coon's The Story of Man to introduce this program on anthropology. Loren Eiseley discusses the range and depth of anthropology and some of its branches, such as cultural, physical, and applied anthropology. William Straus, who specializes in primates and evolution, introduces Dr. Tom, a chimpanzee. He discusses the increase in size and complexity of man's brain compared to apes' and compares several skulls as evidence of man's probable evolution from apes. Dr. Straus also considers a skull from Pithecanthropus man from Java. A film clip of gibbons indicates their similarity to man in many respects. Dr. Eiseley explains a map of early man's migration related to his eating practices and increased brain capacity. He also shows photographs of archaeological sites in Oregon yielding 10,000-30,000 year-old fossils as well as Folsom man projectile points found in New Mexico. He explains that findings can be dated by geological strata, paleontological research of bones, and anatomical determination of human skeleton ages. Thus students seeking careers in anthropology should have a broad background in science, history, and the humanities.

Martin Company of Baltimore, discusses Project Vanguard, the U.S. contribution to the 1957-58 International Geophysical Year. He shows a three-stage rocket and a diagram of its launch and various stages. It will circle the earth in an elliptical orbit every 90 minutes for several weeks, sending back scientific data during that time. A film of White Sands Proving Grounds shows the Martin Company's Viking high altitude rocket, the first designed by the Naval Research Laboratory for scientific research and the Vanguard's first stage. A camera in its tail records the curvature of the earth and other information about its flight. The film also shows the fires and crashes of previous Viking failures as well as the launch of the first Viking from the deck of the U.S.S. Norton Sound while carrying instruments. Lynn Poole interviews three of the project's engineers: Elliott Felt, who explains how the automatic pilot works; Don Markarian, who explains the fins on the Viking rocket for roll control and other details on a model of the craft; and Leonard Arnowitz, who shows an actual Viking motor. Mr. Trimble says the qualities of a rocket engineer include a pioneering spirit and a desire to create something new. He also notes that an engineering degree is important, but 40% of his employees do not have one, taking current technical and science courses instead. He stresses that although a slide rule has become the sign of an engineer, imagination is just as critical.",62cfdefb-9b9a-4039-980b-ef8048fb0c1b,bb3ea708-ba7c-47c7-81e7-e6041d1a11c8,,b13a7bd3-36ed-4838-a661-d2edd4c7924e,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Tomorrow's careers on February 14, 1956 from the studios of WAAM in Baltimore, Md.

James Allen, an intern in medicine at Johns Hopkins, describes his duties and adds that doctors need to deal compassionately with relatives of patients as well as with the patients themselves. William Knauer, a resident in ophthalmology, has been studying medicine for twelve years and describes his responsibilities at the Johns Hopkins Wilmer Eye Clinic.

Guest Gene Bordinat, vice president of Ford Motor Co. in charge of styling and assistant to George W. Walker, is the chief designer of the Mercury. He explains that in designing a car, he must consider not only what the American public wants but also management's bottom line, since a complete body and chassis change costs the company $75 million. Because of automotive competition, Bordinat can not show forthcoming models, but he does display some ""dream cars,"" such as the XM Turnpike Cruiser and the Taj Mahal, which are impractical to produce but which offer design features applicable to practical cars. He enumerates the steps in creating new models from design to production, including engineering, manufacturing, financing, and safety considerations. A film shows the Ford assembly line and testing labs. Bordinat shows a typical 3/8 scale clay model of the XM Turnpike Cruiser and discusses its design features and proportions. His design ideas come from observing various shapes, and he applies them to auto styling, such as elements of a B-52 bomber appearing as impact units (bumpers) on the Cruiser.

Colonel Mason, a graduate of Harvard and student of John Gallishaw, is the author of numerous historical novels and juvenile books, some translated into 18 languages. He maintains that waiting for inspiration is nonsense and that the writer should keep regular hours. His method of composition is to dictate his stories to a secretary who transcribes the drafts on yellow, then blue, then white paper. Colonel Mason explains that the two types of novels are stories of accomplishment and stories of decision. The elements of any story should include who, when, where, and how and should create urgencies or crises, as his impromptu story exemplifies. He describes his travels and research for his most recently published book, Silver Leopard, about the First Crusade, and displays his research notebook for his current work, Our Valiant Few, about the Civil War. His advice to young writers is to study with a competent teacher, write daily, don't quit your job after selling your first story, and remember that writing is more perspiration than inspiration. The second guest, Holmes Alexander, studied and wrote at Princeton and Cambridge. He then taught writing at the McDonough School, a private Baltimore school, and wrote book reviews and other pieces. When he was elected to the Maryland legislature, he wrote about his campaign and sold the story to Harpers. After that he became a reporter with The Baltimore Sun, covering county politics and Johns Hopkins University. He wrote biographies of Martin Van Buren and Aaron Burr as well as other books, nonfiction articles on horses, and fictional baseball stories, which he sold to such magazines as Saturday Evening Post, Colliers, and Esquire. He became Kiplinger's senior editor and ultimately a syndicated columnist. His advice to aspiring writers is to go where the trouble is to get the news, be able to write anywhere, and ignore obstacles to writing. A party at the end of this program celebrates the eighth year of Johns Hopkins programs with WAAM and the first anniversary of ""Tomorrow's Careers."" Herbert Cahan hosts the party, Mrs. Kennard Calfee presents the cake, and Lynn Poole introduces the staff. In addition to those normally appearing in the credits, he includes Dick Zibner (new assistant producer), Andy Bevins (floor manager), John Stokes and Allen Holmes (cameramen), and mentions Herman and Ben Cohen (of WAAM Network) and John Charles Daly (of ABC).",62cfdefb-9b9a-4039-980b-ef8048fb0c1b,bb3ea708-ba7c-47c7-81e7-e6041d1a11c8,,b13a7bd3-36ed-4838-a661-d2edd4c7924e,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Tomorrow's careers on March 6, 1956 from the studios of WAAM in Baltimore, Md.

Diagnosis sometimes depends of laboratory aids to confirm clinical impressions. Microscopic changes can be recognized to help determine the management and treatment of dermatoses. The understanding of the physiology of the skin and the diagnosis of skin conditions and diseases are necessary for the dermatologist. Treatment methods are more diversified than in any other medical specialty. There are internal medications such as anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-histamines, hormones, sedatives and injectable medications. Topical therapy uses lotions, ointments, soaps, and compresses. Other treatments include physical therapy, ultraviolet light, x-ray and radium therapy, cryotherapy, and surgery. The influence of professors and teachers is very important in guiding students into the various aspects of medicine. In fact the teachers must be constantly learning as post-graduates to keep up with the latest developments to stay in touch with their students.

He comments that a railroad is never complete because of its responsibility to change in industry. Mr. Henry explains the car classification operation at Conway Yard near Pittsburgh, and a film further elaborates on the process, including the role of the hump conductor. Railroad engineers must see the overall picture to construct a line with minimum cost and maximum efficiency. For example, they must find the best route by using aerial photography. Film clips show techniques developed by engineers to unload shipments of foreign ore onto railroad cars. Electronic and mechanical engineers also develop new railway technology, such as track safety features; maintain rolling stock, as at the Hollidaysburg, PA freight car repair shop; and design experimental passenger cars, such as the stainless steel Budd cars and the GM Aerotrain. Carl Bergman notes that inspecting and maintaining track and allied structures acquaints railroad engineers in training with all aspects of the job, even though most maintenance jobs are now mechanized. He explains the composition and construction of a track and narrates a film showing a machine that detects defects in the rail and other maintenance equipment.

He is assisted by a team consisting of a secretary, chemists, a photographic specialist, doctors, police, and specialists in the physical sciences. In dealing with crimes of violence or mysterious death, Dr. Fisher asks: Who is the victim? Is it murder or suicide? When did it happen? How did it happen? Who did it? He shows a photo of a charred body and explains when and how the death occurred and the importance of an autopsy and a post-mortem examination. Dr. Fisher compares blood samples and explains how they are used by a courtroom doctor to exonerate or convict the accused. Using sketches from Lynn Poole's book ""Science, the Super Sleuth,"" Dr. Fisher describes what he looks for in knifing murders. He also tells the case of the arsenic in the pancake flour and demonstrates how the presence of arsenic was confirmed. Lynn Poole shows snapshots of Dr. Fisher as a student in the toxicology lab at Georgia Tech as well as photos from throughout his career in forensic medicine. Dr. Fisher says that this career is different and challenging every day and that there are many opportunities for medical examiners and other trained specialists, with salaries from $17,000-20,000.",62cfdefb-9b9a-4039-980b-ef8048fb0c1b,bb3ea708-ba7c-47c7-81e7-e6041d1a11c8,,b13a7bd3-36ed-4838-a661-d2edd4c7924e,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Tomorrow's careers on October 8, 1955 from the studios of WAAM in Baltimore, Md.

Director Amy Winslow heads a staff of 472 working in Pratt's main library, 27 branches, and 2 mobile units. A film shows and describes professional librarians performing various duties, a page boy's activities, the circulation desk with photographic charger, the ready reference desk, catalogers, acquisitions, preparations department, print shop, children's department, art studio, and branch library functions. Mr. Dickson tells Lynn Poole that he's a librarian because he likes to help people, to exercise his resourcefulness, and to perform worthwhile social work. He says the qualifications of a good librarian should include curiosity, orderliness, enjoyment and understanding of books, good eyesight, and ""well-sprung arches."" The Johns Hopkins University librarian, John Berthel, broadly explains his duties and the appeal of working in a large research library. He says that many of the job qualifications are the same as those for a public librarian but also adds interest in one or more subject fields, knowledge of foreign languages, business management skills, good judgment, and a sense of humor. Mr. Dickson notes that the education requirements to become a librarian include a college degree in liberal arts and a year of graduate library training.

Dr. Russell Morgan, Director of Radiology Dept. at Johns Hopkins University, fields questions from members of the press: Nate Hazeltine, a ""Washington Post"" science writer; Pare Lorentz, a film producer; and Earl Ubell, a reporter and science editor with the ""New York Herald Tribune"". Dr. Morgan explains that x-rays affect both individual cells and the whole body, making them more susceptible to premature aging. He discusses the research by John Lawrence on the effects of radiation on mice and their extrapolation to man. He also notes a study on radiation vs. non-radiation workers that showed no difference in life spans of the two groups. It is the amount of radiation exposure that determines the effects of the damage. For example, a chest x-ray only delivers about 1/20th roentgen, a unit of radiation. However, Dr. Morgan discusses the feasibility of a reporting system for patients' total x-ray exposure and the need for a set of standards. And he does admit that the complexity and amount of radiation exposure is increasing in diagnostic studies and could double by 1960-65. A film clip demonstrates that this radiation exposure can be reduced by filtration, distance from the x-ray machine, length of time of exposure, and protection of areas not being radiated. Mr. Poole points out that Dr. Morgan has developed a fluoroscopy machine reducing by up to ten times the radiation time. In conclusion, Dr. Morgan discusses whether the Atomic Energy Commission or the U. S. Public Health Services should be responsible for the public's radiation health problems.",62cfdefb-9b9a-4039-980b-ef8048fb0c1b,bb3ea708-ba7c-47c7-81e7-e6041d1a11c8,,b13a7bd3-36ed-4838-a661-d2edd4c7924e,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins File 7 on January 20, 1957 from the studios of WAAM in Baltimore, Md.

Later, Frenchman Niepce discovered an emulsion that could retain a photographic image. Dr. Walter Driscoll, director of research at Baird-Atomic Inc., then shows a chart of the electromagnetic spectrum and notes that while x-rays yield only shadowy pictures and radar waves detect but don't create pictures, germanium and silicon filters block radiated energy and allow infrared light to pass through to form an image. Dr. Driscoll displays a scanning bolometer, which can see in the dark, but the shapes it creates need to be interpreted. He also shows a snooperscope and a film clip of a sniperscope with infrared scope. Previous research on infrared or thermal detection was done by Sir John Frederick William Herschel. Potter Trainer demonstrates and explains the Evaporagraph (EVA), which is based on the principle that all things radiate heat as infrared rays, and shows some of the actual pictures made from heat rather than light. Dr. Walter Baird describes applications of EVA to industry, such as detecting problem-causing hot spots in electronic equipment or indicating heat escape or insulation deficiency in a building. EVA's resolution is 10 lines/mm at best, and it shows temperature contrast of .2 degree. The machine's weakness is the slow speed of response to small temperature differences and the inability to obtain the temperature scale of the item viewed.

He explains the differences between independent inventionists, researchers who believe in indigenous cultures that developed independently, and diffusionists, scholars who maintain that there was early contact between civilizations. Pre-1492 contacts between the old world and the new appear impossible, but evidence shows similarities in games, instruments, tools, math, religion, etc. in both Asia and the Americas. The existence of domestic plants, such as the sweet potato, in both places and with the same name, seems proof that man crossed the oceans during pre-Columbian times. Evidence in art may support the diffusionists too, according to Dr. Gordon Ekholm, curator of archaeology at the American Museum of Natural History.

Lynn Poole discusses increasing U. S. energy needs and predicts that the world may run out of coal in 1000 years and oil in 100 years, making solar energy a critical commodity. A film clip shows the sun's surface and its energy generation is discussed. John Yellott, executive director for the Association for Applied Solar Energy, says that space heating will be the first large use of solar energy. He explains the workings of a solar-heated house with auxiliary heat pump designed by University of Minnesota architecture student Peter Lee and engineered by Bridgers and Paxton. According to Mr. Yellot, the basic instruments of solar energy are collectors, concentrators, photoelectricity, and photochemistry. He shows how solar stills can convert salt water into fresh; solar furnaces can be used for metallurgy and other research; and solar stoves can be designed for arid countries where fuel is scarce. Mr. Poole uses a photo flood light to light a cigarette and shows how selenium cells operate a photoelectric exposure meter and 8mm movie camera. Mr. Yellott demonstrates a radio/phonograph developed by Admiral Corp. to run on solar cells with backup storage batteries. Mr. Yellot concludes that at this time large scale uses of solar energy are too expensive, but solar is ideal for small amounts of energy in isolated places. More research is needed in harnessing this inexhaustible source of power.",62cfdefb-9b9a-4039-980b-ef8048fb0c1b,bb3ea708-ba7c-47c7-81e7-e6041d1a11c8,,b13a7bd3-36ed-4838-a661-d2edd4c7924e,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins File 7 on October 6, 1957 from the studios of WJZ in Baltimore, Md.

Lynn Poole shows an Egyptian bronze statuette that had become disfigured by bronze disease. Johns Hopkins chemistry professor Dr. Alsoph H. Corwin helped to develop a technique to reverse the corrosion on pieces like this and to restore the corroded coffer of the Dead Sea Scrolls. John Kirby, of Baltimore's Walters Art Gallery conservation department, briefly describes the Walters' collection and the job of the museum conservation staff. A film shows the conservation studio's equipment and procedures, such as the successive steps in relining the canvas of a painting. Another film shows how the wax immersion process reinforces and preserves deteriorating wood sculptures. Elisabeth Packard, also on the Walters staff, shows an example of the nineteenth century practice of piecing together unrelated fragments of sculptures and explains how conservators try to recognize and reconstruct the proper form. Mr. Kirby displays an ivory figurine from Crete whose fragments were reconstituted with gelatin and metal rods. Miss Packard discusses how paintings and other artwork are x-rayed and the damages, repairs, alterations, and brushwork that are discovered. Mr. Kirby demonstrates professional cleaning and restoring of a painting. Mr. Poole shows a painting of Maria Salviatti by Pontormo that was x-rayed and restored to reveal a child painted over by the mother's skirt. Miss Packard demonstrates retouching a painting to fill in breaks in paint by ""in-painting,"" as opposed to ""over-painting,"" which conceals the original paint.

Dr. Donald Andrews, chemistry professor at Johns Hopkins University, says that man has learned how to harness and control the atom's energy in such projects as atomic submarines and power plants, but we can not yet harness or control hydrogen, the newest source of nuclear power. To do that, machines need to supplement man's brain, offering ""automatic control"" or cybernetics. Examples of this include analog machines that regulate single functions, like James Watts' fly ball governor to control steam to the engine (demonstrated in animated film), thermostats that work on a feedback loop, servoengines that correct the course of a ship, and automated pilots on planes. Dr. Andrews then demonstrates thermodynamics, which studies the relations between heat and motion, and shows visible and audible evidence of a gas using dry ice. He defines entropy as the degree of randomness in a situation expressed by probabilities. Claude Shannon was the first person to see the parallel between entropy and the theory of information, which makes possible more complex automatic control devices. Self-regulating machines still need human monitoring, but digital information machines, or computers, can handle more complex situations, such as reacting to emergencies. A filmed narrative describes IBM's Model 705 equipment and statistics. Dr. Andrews says that computers will become the instruments of overall control. Cartoons show the statistics, promises, and fears of mechanization in business, industry, and government, concluding that by 1965, the United States, with a population of 190,000,000 will require a 50% increase in production. Dr. Andrews also predicts that in the future automatic control machines will make possible automatically steered cars, continuous television with an on-request program selector for shows in full color and 3-D, interplanetary transportation within 100 years, and modification of conditions on other planets by robots for colonization of space. The program concludes with a brief film of the launching of an artificial earth satellite placed in orbit by a three-stage rocket as America's contribution to the 1957-58 International Geophysical Year.",62cfdefb-9b9a-4039-980b-ef8048fb0c1b,bb3ea708-ba7c-47c7-81e7-e6041d1a11c8,,b13a7bd3-36ed-4838-a661-d2edd4c7924e,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins File 7 on January 6, 1957 from the studios of WAAM in Baltimore, Md.

Dr. William A. McDonald, assistant director of the Baltimore Museum of Art, explains the artist's creative process. He compares naturalism vs. emotional reaction to a subject by comparing two paintings of cats. Artists may distort form, color, or size to emphasize qualities that are important. Both artists and sculptors use horizontal lines to express serenity and diagonal or curved lines for movement, as exemplified in the dance movements of a Kirchner painting and a Matisse sculpture. Dr. McDonald discusses the heavy black lines, borrowed from stained glass making, in Georges Rouault's ""The Crucifixion,"" and the swirling lines in Vincent Van Gogh's ""Starry Night,"" an example of expressionism. The German expressionists were influenced by the abstract art of Africa and used lines to evoke inner feelings. Displayed examples of this school include a Pechstein woodcut, a Kathe Kollwitz drawing, a Heckel self-portrait, and Miro's happier painting ""Summer.""

Dr. Sidney Painter, professor of history at The Johns Hopkins University, discusses chivalry, from the French ""chevalier"", or knight, referring to the ideals of the knightly class. He summarizes the events of the Middle Ages and notes that warfare and women were the guiding influences of that period. The knights, originally barbarous in desires and actions, listened to ""chansons de geste"", poems of war, but they became more civilized as troubadours changed their tunes. ""The Story of Roland"", for example, suggests that knights were to protect the church and punish criminals. Courtly poems laid the foundation for ""preux"", a term denoting prowess and all the virtues of chivalry.

Dr. Kenneth Monty, a biochemist professor at Johns Hopkins University, discusses research on the effect of radiation on chromosomes and Russian A. I. Oparin's theory of the origin of life. A chart shows single-celled organisms, such as amoebae, and Dr. Monty comments on reproduction from a single cell. The 1953 Urey-Miller experiment attempted to recreate the conditions of the primordial atmosphere with carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen resulting in the precursors of amino acids, the main components of living cells. Scientist Sidney Fox also discovered that amino acids will organize spontaneously into protein molecules. Animated segments show amino acids, proteins, and nucleotides and how accidents in the original cells resulted in mutation, heredity, and evolution. Nucleic acids are the carriers of heredity and responsible for transformation. Dr. Franco Rasetti, a Johns Hopkins professor of physics who worked with Enrico Fermi in Rome, discusses his 10,000-specimen collection of trilobites or fossilized remains of marine life. He shows specimens and photos of various trilobites as old as 500 million years and notes that there is a gap between one-celled organisms and these diversified forms of life from the Cambrian Period.

Dr. William Montagna, professor of biology at Brown University, looks at bones from an artistic point of view. He displays the lumbar vertebrae of both a whale and a human and notes their structure. He contrasts the humerus from the upper arm, the scapula from the shoulder, and the carpal bones of the wrist. Comparing the skulls of a man and a woman, Dr. Montagna explains the differences. The three types of joints he lists are the fused in the skull, the hinge-type in the elbow, and the ball and socket in the shoulder and hip. Investigating the interior of bones, Dr. Montagna shows the frontal sinuses of the head and compares the spongy bone material at each end of a bone to a bridge structure. For strength and resiliency, bones require both organic and inorganic substance, which Dr. Montagna demonstrates with bones lacking one or the other. A diagram shows how the endosteum and the periosteum balance bone growth. X-ray films compare the hands of a three-year-old, which has cartilage at the end of each bone, and a thirty-year-old, which has bone in place. Dr. Montagna concludes that bone is a living tissue, as evidenced by its mechanism to repair itself quickly.",62cfdefb-9b9a-4039-980b-ef8048fb0c1b,bb3ea708-ba7c-47c7-81e7-e6041d1a11c8,Two hundred and six bones,b13a7bd3-36ed-4838-a661-d2edd4c7924e,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins File 7 on April 28, 1957 from the studios of WAAM in Baltimore, Md.

Dr. Albert Krall, a plant biochemist at the same institute, discusses respiration of plants and reports the two problems his research is trying to solve: how energy is converted into chemical energy and by which enzymatic steps is energy stored. He notes that in 1828 Friedrich Wohler laid the foundation for organic chemistry, and in 1896 Eduard Buchner opened the era of biochemistry. Now the Calvin Group in California has traced the path of carbon through a plant during photosynthesis showing that sunlight acts on the chlorophyll to make organic compounds. Dr. Krall shows a mock-up model of a chloroplast with grana and a hypothetical model representing the enzymatic reaction during photosynthesis. Dr. Bessel Kok, a plant physiologist with the institute, describes a microscopic view of a plant cell.

Dr. Milton S. Eisenhower, president of Johns Hopkins University, reports that there are 7,000 private foundations in the U. S. with assets of over $7 billion. He discusses their varied interests noting that this program will focus on a representative foundation's private gifts to education. Henry T. Heald, president of the Ford Foundation, explains that the purpose of this foundation's twenty programs is to advance human welfare. Secretary of the Ford Foundation Joseph M. McDaniel points out that foundations can be discriminating, flexible, and can show by example. He describes the Ford Foundation's funding of both the Woodrow Wilson program for attracting able students into the teaching field and the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City. Mr. McDaniel explains that about 400 applications are funded from the 5,000 received annually. These are selected because they seem to provide the best solutions to issues that are within the foundation's purpose and interests. Clarence H. Faust, president of the Fund for the Advancement of Education of the Ford Foundation, describes some of the teacher shortage solutions supported by this fund. For example, this fund contributes to new school construction, and in 1955 it partnered with the Carnegie Foundation to create the National Merit Scholarship Corp. to provide scholarships to send more students to college. Mr. Faust also discusses the ""Hagerstown Project"" in Washington County, MD where a grant from the Ford Foundation has supplied funds for a five-year experiment using closed circuit television for classroom instruction.",62cfdefb-9b9a-4039-980b-ef8048fb0c1b,bb3ea708-ba7c-47c7-81e7-e6041d1a11c8,,b13a7bd3-36ed-4838-a661-d2edd4c7924e,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins File 7 on May 3, 1958 from the studios of WJZ in Baltimore, Md.

Dr. George Carter, department chair and professor of geography at Johns Hopkins University, discusses the possibility of a land bridge from Siberia to Alaska across the Bering Strait, based on human tools found with mastodon remains. Likewise, zoologist R.G. Gilmore has discovered that animals crisscrossed the Bering Strait between ice periods. In describing the history of the study of pre-history, Dr. Carter names W.H. Holmes and Ales Hrdlicka as men who led the opposition to the previously generally accepted belief in the existence of a glacial age man in America. With Willard F. Libby's 1951 discovery that all living things contain radioactive carbon, remains could be dated, challenging previous beliefs. From evidence such as stone tools, Dr. Carter speculates that man entered America about 40,000 years ago. He creates a timeline based on the degree of skill in making tools, the degree of weathering on tools, and the date of the existence of the lake where the tools were found. Dr. Carter also discusses physical geography and carbon-14 dating of tools along the southern California coast. Using charts and photos, he shows how reading California river valley records also yields data about sea level, climate, and glaciers.

Dr. John Woodburn, assistant director of the Johns Hopkins masters in teaching program, offers courses to working teachers wanting an advanced degree. He maintains that teachers can interest children in science by exposing them to the phenomena of nature, asking questions, teaching them to notice things around them, and showing them the scientific principles in everyday things. To illustrate, teacher Jacqueline Wolfe performs a simple experiment, and students in her fifth grade class from Woodmore School in Baltimore, MD, observe, hypothesize, test tentative hypotheses, and verbalize final conclusions.

The ballad ""Barbara Allen"" can be traced to the mid-1600s in Scotland, with several versions of the tragic fate of the rejected lover evolving over time and continents. Mike Seeger sings one version with a fiddle; Larry Marxer performs another variant with guitar; and Ms. Hughes sings still another with dulcimer. Mr. Sturgill shows the typical instruments played in the Appalachians: melodian or autoharp, dulcimer, banjo, guitar, harmonica, mandolin, whistle, and fiddle, and Seeger plays ""Black Mt.

Dr. Dayton Carritt, assistant director of the Chesapeake Bay Institute, considers the future of earth sciences: rockets will orbit the earth and send back weather information, nuclear power will be developed, and ocean circulation will be studied for possible food production. In the area of life sciences, biology professor William McElroy discusses nutritional requirements to relieve diseases, trapping solar energy, the physiology of space travel, insights on aging, and other possibilities in a ""golden age of medicine."" Professor of microbiology Thomas B. Turner predicts space medicine, electronic equipment for the handicapped, public protection against radioactivity, better surgical methods for transplants, and the reduction or elimination of heart disease, polio, and cancer. Professor Charles Singleton maintains that the humanities will continue to survive as long as we ask ""What is a man?"" and ""What does it mean to be where we are?"" In communications, chemistry professor Donald Hatch predicts the extension of television networks as well as 3-D television programs and programs on demand. Professor of physics Theodore Berlin lists future energy issues such as control of thermonuclear fusion reactions, problems with radioactive wastes, application of atomic energy (but not in homes or vehicles), transformation of devices to control energy, and development of solid fuels and solar energy. According to Francis Clauser, professor of aeronautics, in the realm of space travel, commercial airlines will fly at supersonic speeds; guided missiles and anti-missile devices will be the backbone of defense; the U.S. will enjoy peaceful space travel with the Russians; and a rocket will go to the moon. To reinforce this view, Wernher von Braun, in a taped segment, predicts that the U.S. will launch a man into outer space, he will orbit and return to earth.

He shows a diagram of the dendrites and axons of the neurons and explains a cross-section model of a neuron. Lynn Poole lists some of the history of the research on brain functions, including that of the early German phrenologist Franz Joseph Gall. In 1817 it was demonstrated that electrical stimulus applied to the brain produced movement on the opposite side of the brain, giving rise to the existence of motor areas of the brain. Using a brain cross-section diagram related to various parts of the body, Dr. Walker shows how the sensory cortex, or homunculus, is closely correlated with the motor cortex. He also discusses what happens when these areas are injured and how they affect vision, hearing, and speech. The association area of the brain is the temporal lobe. Personality and drive may be located in the frontal lobe as lobotomies in that area produce personality change and induce apathy. Additional research is needed to discover if patterns of pathways between nerve cells are responsible for psychological differences.",62cfdefb-9b9a-4039-980b-ef8048fb0c1b,bb3ea708-ba7c-47c7-81e7-e6041d1a11c8,,b13a7bd3-36ed-4838-a661-d2edd4c7924e,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins File 7 on April 4, 1958 from the studios of WAAM in Baltimore, Md.

Dr. Richard Green, assistant professor of English at Johns Hopkins University, summarizes Chaucer's life and the basic plot of the work, noting that Chaucer was a civil servant primarily rather than a writer but was a satirical observer of human folly. The thirty pilgrims of ""The Canterbury Tales"" thus represent all types of human beings. Dr. Green maintains that Chaucer was an early popularizer of romantic love and ideal marriage and that the moral purpose in Chaucer's love stories was that man should love God first and all other things only in so far as they lead him to love of God. While costumed actors interpret, Dr. Green reads passages from the Wife of Bath's account of five marriages, the Clerk's tale of Walter and Grisilde, and the Nun's Priest's story of Chauntecleer and Pertelote to show that a wife's submission to her husband is symbolic of reason over passion and of man's love of God, but a domineering woman turns this upside down and causes reason to be governed by passion.",62cfdefb-9b9a-4039-980b-ef8048fb0c1b,bb3ea708-ba7c-47c7-81e7-e6041d1a11c8,,b13a7bd3-36ed-4838-a661-d2edd4c7924e,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins File 7 on March 29, 1958 from the studios of WAAM in Baltimore, Md.

This first political protest after the American Revolution was a precursor of Jacksonian democracy and led to the creation of the U.S. Constitution. At issue were the farmers caught between mounting debts and insufficient gold-backed paper currency in circulation. In numerous towns in western Massachusetts, such as Northampton, Worcester, Great Barrington, armed mobs prevented the supreme judicial courts from sitting and sending debtors to prison. They were led by Capt. Daniel Shays, a veteran of the Revolution and farmer from Pelham, MA. Gen. Lincoln's army was sent to suppress the insurrections and protect the judicial courts. On January 25, 1787, Shays' rebels attacked the arsenal at Springfield, MA, but were rebuffed by Gen. Shepard's troops. With the exception of two, the rebels were pardoned after asking forgiveness, and the government made the reforms they sought. Dr. Barker recommends two books about the incident: George Richard Minot's famous ""History of the Insurrections in Massachusetts"" and the historical fiction ""Duke of Stockbridge"" by Edward Bellamy.",62cfdefb-9b9a-4039-980b-ef8048fb0c1b,bb3ea708-ba7c-47c7-81e7-e6041d1a11c8,,b13a7bd3-36ed-4838-a661-d2edd4c7924e,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins File 7 on February 1, 1958 from the studios of WAAM in Baltimore, Md.

He asks a member of that Lab, Dr. Richard Kershner, to explain how the missile works and how it was developed. Dr. Kershner shows a film of the missile in action, noting that it doesn't actually hit the target but explodes within close proximity of it. On a mock-up he identifies the payload or warhead and the solid fuel rocket engine with booster rocket. The guidance control system allows ""beam riding"" as the onboard computer corrects the missile's course, and the missile's antennae pick up the intensity of the radar beams' mutations. A transmitter on the ground sends a reference signal to the receiver on the missile, a signature beam that prevents jamming by other radar beams. The electronic information received permits the four hydraulic tail fins to control its flight altitude. Dr. Kershner also explains a model of one of the terrier's control units. The first beam-rider missile was begun in 1947, and its problems were gradually eliminated, as shown in a film shot from a booster section showing ""flutter."" Development of such complex missiles requires not only a team of specialists in many fields but also systems engineers or specialty generalists to produce an integrated final product.

""Show me the dancing of any people, and I will tell you what their king is like"" is a Chinese proverb claiming that dance reveals the state of a culture. Shawn says the motivation for dance is that it brings satisfaction. The gamut of human emotions is the basis for dance, as evidenced in the Greek theater, which was based on dance. Dance was originally solo and then social. Shawn shows a film of Australian aborigines dancing their stories and film clips of liturgical dance. Dance has long been a form of religious expression and ecstasy. Shawn shows photos and film clips of some of his dances based on religious themes such as the whirling dervish, St. Francis, and Shiva. He discusses turn of the century dance, which used very sterile technical styles. However, Isadora Duncan and Ruth St. Denis initiated the renaissance of dance and the forerunner of modern dance. Film footage shows St. Denis's 1910 ""Incense"" and Shawn and St. Denis in ""Tillers of the Soil.""

This increase in quantity threatens to reduce the quality of education. Public institutions will find it easier to receive funds than will private institutions because endowment incomes have not kept pace with rising costs nor does tuition meet all needs. Dr. Eisenhower compares the Russian system of education to that of the United States and suggests that our national security is at risk. Solutions to U.

Dr. Bordley explains the hearing process using a mock-up of the inner ear and brain. Dr. Pauls discusses children's normal speech development and shows children in this learning process. Dr. Hardy gives examples of how damage to the external or middle ear causes minor hearing problems, but damage to the inner ear causes hearing distortion. Since the hearing mechanism is an information bearing system, children who have problems with loudness, pitch, or both can have decoding issues. However, sight, taste, and smell also contribute to learning, so staff and parents can teach a repetitive, all-sensory form of learning, especially for children with aphasia, who have language problems unrelated to hearing loss. A film shows the observation and evaluation of a child in the clinic to determine whether he has hearing or language problems or a combination of the two.

Dr. William Avery, of Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Lab, describes how techniques of flight have changed from the Chinese rocket of 1232 AD to the ramjet. Isaac Newton's equal and opposite principle was the basis for jet propulsion, and its first use was in jet-assisted takeoffs, which allowed shorter runways. Dr. Avery shows a diagram of a solid fuel rocket consisting of propellant grain, nozzle, and warhead and contrasts it with a liquid propellant rocket consisting of rocket fuel and oxidizer tanks, combustion chamber, warhead, and valves and pumps. He notes that liquid fuel rockets are more subject to failure than solid fuel ones. Dr. Avery briefly describes the work of rocket pioneers Tsiolkovskiy, Goddard, and Oberth. Further research in the field resulted in the air-breathing engine during World War II, pulse jet engine (loud and limited in speed), turbojet engine by Briton Frank Whittle, and ramjet engine, first proposed by Rene Lorin in 1910 but requiring supersonic speed. Dr. Avery describes the key components of the ramjet: the diffuser, fuel system, and combustor. He then explains graphs comparing the ramjet and turbojet in four areas of performance and limitations: thrust per unit frontal area, specific fuel impulse, thrust per unit weight, and speed and altitude limits, proving ramjet the more economical to use. In concluding, Dr. Avery shows how a 1970 airliner with both turbojet and ramjet engines will look and operate.",62cfdefb-9b9a-4039-980b-ef8048fb0c1b,bb3ea708-ba7c-47c7-81e7-e6041d1a11c8,,b13a7bd3-36ed-4838-a661-d2edd4c7924e,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins File 7 on February 22, 1958 from the studios of WAAM in Baltimore, Md.

In 1932, Karl Jansky, from Bell Labs, discovered radio noise from space. Five years later Grote Reber built the first antenna for astronomical observations. The sun was discovered to be a source of radiation and radio waves, as were the Milky Way and Crab Nebula. Later J. G. Bolton and J. G. Stanley discovered a variable source of cosmic radio frequency radiation in the constellation Cygnus. That plus Cassiopeia are the most intense radio sources in the heavens. Additional research resulted in Martin Ryle's development of interferometric techniques, A. E. Lilly's observation of the spiral structure of the universe, and J. H. Oort's mapping of our own galaxy. In 1944, H. Van de Hulst predicted that a hydrogen cloud produces radiation in the radio range of 21cm wavelength. E. Purcell and H. Ewen confirmed this theory, detecting a 21cm cosmic gas emission from neutral hydrogen in the Milky Way in 1951. Ohio University's John Kraus was instrumental in detecting the Milky Way's radio transmissions. In 1955, the Mills Cross Array, a simple radio antenna built by Australian B. Mills, was used to record the radio noise produced by the planet Jupiter. The antenna most commonly used is the paraboloidal reflector with a diameter of 80-90 ft. The largest steerable radio reflector is at Jodrell Bank in the UK. Plans for the National Radio Astronomical Observatory at Green Bank, West Virginia are underway at the time of this program. Increasing research will help to explain whether the explosion theory or the continuous creation theory of the universe is more valid.",62cfdefb-9b9a-4039-980b-ef8048fb0c1b,bb3ea708-ba7c-47c7-81e7-e6041d1a11c8,,b13a7bd3-36ed-4838-a661-d2edd4c7924e,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins File 7 on January 18, 1958 from the studios of WAAM in Baltimore, Md.

Friedrich Jahn, the father of gymnastics, developed the sport in Germany in 1910. Head gymnastics coach Chet Phillips says that gymnastics requires coordination, form, and grace and that fluidity or elegance, without breaks, is critical. A Naval Academy team member demonstrates a routine on the side horse, the least hazardous of the apparatus. Assistant coach John Rammacher describes the swings, releases and catches, somersaults, and holds required in a routine on the parallel bars, the easiest piece of equipment to start. Members of the gymnastics team demonstrate swings, vaults, and somersaults on the high bar, the most dangerous event, and Mr. Phillips explains the importance of chalking hands to perform well. Tumbling team members demonstrate the variations of somersaults, including roundoffs, required for a routine in this event.",62cfdefb-9b9a-4039-980b-ef8048fb0c1b,bb3ea708-ba7c-47c7-81e7-e6041d1a11c8,,b13a7bd3-36ed-4838-a661-d2edd4c7924e,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins File 7 on April 5, 1959 from the studios of WJZ in Baltimore, Md.

Dr. J.W. Gebhard, research psychologist with the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab (APL), explains that his job is to improve the way men interpret radar pictures on an A-scope. He then demonstrates a PPI (plan position indicator) scope, which uses a bearing dial and cursor to locate a target. Dr. Albert Stone, a physicist with the APL, explains that RADAR is an acronym for ""radio detection and ranging,"" which measures unknown distances accurately. He demonstrates radar's principles and explains how it works, including the radar antenna that indicates direction. A film shows a police radar speed meter in operation. This is doppler radar, measuring only velocity. Other film clips show the use of radar at sea for guiding ships into harbors, air radar for a flight across Lake Erie, and storm forecasting radar.

Dr. Boas responds that there are four reasons for problems becoming obsolete, and he gives examples of each: they are insoluble; peoples' interests change; they arise from assumptions no longer held; and the problems themselves go out of style. When Mr. Poole asks if there are any humanistic problems whose solution would affect the lives of many people, Dr. Boas lists standardized textbooks in education, the trend towards authoritarianism, and the elimination of provincialism. He notes that there is no one right answer in the humanities; every person is his own interpreter. He illustrates this with a passage from the play ""Hamlet,"" Piero della Francesca's painting ""Resurrection,"" and the music of Bach's ""St. Matthew Passion.""",62cfdefb-9b9a-4039-980b-ef8048fb0c1b,bb3ea708-ba7c-47c7-81e7-e6041d1a11c8,,b13a7bd3-36ed-4838-a661-d2edd4c7924e,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins File 7 on March 1, 1959 from the studios of WJZ in Baltimore, Md.

Dr. Allen Astin and his colleagues, from the U. S.

Dr. Astin also talks about direct measurement with a simple balance vs. indirect measurement with a proving ring or dynamometer. Dr. Robert Huntoon points out that the earth's rotation varies, so to determine the exact time, the NBS uses quartz crystals, or for more accuracy, ammonium atom vibration or a cesium clock operating on the forces within the cesium atom.

Anderson, professor of American literature at Johns Hopkins University, discusses the life, family, and poetry of Emily Dickinson, who lived in Amherst, Massachusetts from 1830-1886. At age 28 Dickinson fell in love with a married minister, her personality changed, and she began to write poetry, publishing just seven poems and keeping nearly 2,000 in her room. He seclusion became extreme as she renounced the world. However, her poetry keenly expressed New England village life as a microcosm of the larger world. Dr. Anderson discusses some of her more satirical poems, such as ""The Show is not the Show"" (no. 1206) comparing the human race to a menagerie. Other poems reveal the travesty of brokers and bankers, the village gossips (""The Leaves like Women interchange,"" no. 987), and the conventional ladies of the town (""What Soft-Cherubic Creatures,"" no. 130).

Dr. James E. Birren, with the National Institute of Mental Health, discusses how structure is created by a job, spouse, children, friends, and organizations, and when these influences are stripped away, one must initiate one's own meaningful activities to avoid idleness. He characterizes meaningful activity as something offering group approval, a degree of ritual or repetition, a semi-challenge, and a degree or range of uncertainty of outcome. He notes that geriatric research is growing; however, increasing life spans may increase interrelated problems in health, economics, social adjustment, and personal adjustment. Research has shown that usually poor health leads to retirement rather than the opposite, and those who continue working tend to feel better.

Dr. Gus W. Van Beek, Johns Hopkins University archaeologist, says that of written and unwritten remains, archaeology is the only source of information on civilizations before the third millennium B.C., and pottery shreds are the most common remains. On a diagram of the Hajar bin Humeid mound excavated in 1950-51, he shows how each stratum is delineated by debris and specific features. The study of these layers is called stratigraphy. Since ancient pottery styles changed readily, relative chronology of a culture can be based on these changes. For example, the ledge handles on Palestinian jars went through four stages of design change. Likewise, immigration and colonization are revealed by changes in native pottery. Use of literary sources adds to this information for dating objects in the strata as does carbon-14 dating.",62cfdefb-9b9a-4039-980b-ef8048fb0c1b,bb3ea708-ba7c-47c7-81e7-e6041d1a11c8,,b13a7bd3-36ed-4838-a661-d2edd4c7924e,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins File 7 on December 7, 1958 from the studios of WJZ in Baltimore, Md.

Lynn Poole briefly discusses Freud's early work with Joseph Breuer, who used hypnosis to treat patients with hysteria. This led to Freud's version of psychoanalysis. He believed that the human personality was composed of the conscious and unconscious mind and that impressions in childhood, predominantly sexual, which the conscious mind refused to accept became neuroses in the unconscious mind. Freud's publications affected all disciplines, as evidenced in the reading of a stream of consciousness passage from James Joyce's ""Ulysses.""

He then gives the history of Mars from Francesco Fontana's 1636 drawing of the planet to Christian Huygens' comments on possible inhabitants of Mars and Giovanni Schiaparelli's 1877 observation of Mars's channels (mistakenly translated as ""canals"" by others). Mr. Neathery describes a diagram of the planet's orbit between 1956-71 indicating its nearness to the earth every 15 years. Aerology, or the study of the features of Mars, is done with telescope, spectroscope, thermocouple, and camera and reveals polar caps that wax and wane and a reddish color, thought to be desert, covering 75% of the planet's surface. Dr. Neathery shows a cactus in a bell jar containing nitrogen, argon, carbon dioxide, and oxygen in proportions considered similar to those in the Martian atmosphere and compares it to a cactus plant outside the jar. He also uses balloons filled with nitrogen or helium to demonstrate the escape velocity of gravity on earth as compared to the lower surface gravity on Mars. Because oxygen is nearly non-existent on Mars, the temperatures are extreme, and it's unclear whether chlorophyll exists on the planet, Dr. Neathery concludes that Mars is inhospitable to life as we know it. However, he is certain that man's curiosity will take him there. The trip will take eight months, and an artist's rendition shows what will be seen upon landing. Dr. Neathery laments that the public's belief in Orson Welles's 1938 ""War of the Worlds"" radio broadcast is a sad commentary on their understanding of science.",62cfdefb-9b9a-4039-980b-ef8048fb0c1b,bb3ea708-ba7c-47c7-81e7-e6041d1a11c8,Desert world,b13a7bd3-36ed-4838-a661-d2edd4c7924e,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins File 7 on January 17, 1960 from the studios of WJZ in Baltimore, Md.

Clarence Rice, aviation products manager of the Bendix Radio Division in Baltimore, MD, points out that aviation navigation depends on knowing the ground speed and the path of the aircraft over the earth. He uses a chart to demonstrate the effects of winds on plane direction and the efforts to compensate: a homing device, which did not account for wind drift and also picked up static interference; the radio range system, which used four beams to overcome the drift problem but still received static; and the manual direction finder, which became the standard aid in the 1930s. A film describes how, in 1939, Bendix developed the automatic direction finder (ADF) with omnirange, which also eliminated static. Over the ocean, LORAN, or long range navigation, devices were used. Another animated film shows how Christian Doppler, in 1842, described the Doppler effect based on sound waves and how that principle has been applied to radar's radio waves. The film explains the ""plus"" Doppler effect for direct measurement of forward speeds and the ""minus"" for measurement of drift angle. Pitch and roll are also corrected by the radar beams since beam compensation is based on the magnitude of the Doppler shift. A plane's Doppler radar components include a transmitter, antennae, receiver, frequency tracker, and cockpit indicator. Mr. Rice explains how pilots divide their flights into shorter legs, placing the information into the navigational computer. He notes that Doppler radar will not become obsolete with faster aircraft speeds and that it does not require a land-based facility.",62cfdefb-9b9a-4039-980b-ef8048fb0c1b,bb3ea708-ba7c-47c7-81e7-e6041d1a11c8,,b13a7bd3-36ed-4838-a661-d2edd4c7924e,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins File 7 on November 15, 1959 from the studios of WJZ in Baltimore, Md.

Dr. Hart states that the three artistic entities of music are the composer, the orchestra, and the conductor. The composer invents the music, which is made up of rhythm, melody, and harmony. He demonstrates each of these elements with the tune ""Pop Goes the Weasel,"" which he also plays in the styles of Mozart, Bach, Mendelssohn, Debussy, and Prokofiev. Baltimore composer Sidney Shapiro wrote these variations for this broadcast. Next Dr. Hart describes the history of the orchestra and how instruments were added. He shows a chart of the orchestra seating for a 90-member symphony and explains how the sounds are balanced. Lastly, Dr. Hart explains how the conductor and his baton evolved from the church's choirmaster keeping time with his staff.

He gives the planet's distance from sun and earth, its solar orbiting time, its measurements, and its mass, density, and surface gravity and then announces, ""That's all we know."" A brief history of the astronomers who made telescopic observations and early drawings of Venus include Galileo in 1609, Francesco Fontana in 1645, Gian Domenico Cassini in 1666, Francesco Bianchini, William Herschel, and Johann Schroter in 1788. Mr. Streeter says that Venus apparently has an atmosphere because it reflects sunlight and thus must be covered by dense white clouds. Venus's atmosphere was first thought to be like that of the carboniferous period on earth, but a subsequent spectroscopic study showed nothing but carbon dioxide, permitting no life as we know it. However, the Venusian ocean may support one-celled animals. Mr. Streeter describes the history of speculated life on Venus and shows early sketches of Venusians. Film clips show the 1959 balloon and gondola designed by Johns Hopkins University's Dr. John Strong and piloted by Navy commander Malcolm Ross. It rose to an altitude of 80,000, and its spectroscopic data, analyzed by physicist Charles Moore, showed measurable water vapor on Venus.

M. Levitt, Director of the Fels Planetarium of Philadelphia's Franklin Institute, describes the shape, characteristics, and historical formation of the moon. He explains that over 30,000 craters have been counted on the moon, including Tycho, and that the dark areas called ""seas"" by Galileo are actually deserts. Dr. Levitt predicts that because of its low gravity and lack of atmosphere the moon will be used as a launching site for exploring the solar system. For the same reasons, the moon is also an ideal place for asthmatics and heart sufferers. He discusses the Saturn rocket project under Wernher von Braun, which will launch a rocket to the moon. He anticipates that between 1962-68 a man will land on the moon, but first robots must probe the lunar surface and gather data such as temperature. A man models a Navy full pressure suit similar to what astronauts will use in their lunar exploration. Dr. Levitt also predicts that within the next 20 years a nearly self-sustaining colony will be established on the moon. Displaying a lunar housing simulation model, Dr. Levitt describes how fuel, water, atmosphere, and quarters can be made from readily available basic elements on the moon and how algae and hydroponics could form the basis of the food supply. He maintains that the moon is the key to the conquest of space because the earth's gravity is so strong it limits our exploratory distance.

Andrews demonstrates that all matter vibrates in harmonic wave patterns. He begins by using an oscilloscope and slow motion camera to show a plucked harp string's fundamental vibration at 64 times per second and its harmonics at a faster vibration. He compares this with the two-dimensional vibration of a drum membrane, also viewed on the slow motion camera and oscilloscope. Dr. Andrews then progresses to the three-dimensional wavelength of a sphere and notes that different and more complex harmonic patterns are based on the shape of the object. Since no two statues are alike, their wave patterns are all unique, as evidenced when a gadget taps them repetitively and their sound is recorded on magnetic tape. Dr. Andrews slows the tape to hear specific sounds and compares this to slowing a LP record on a record player from high speed to the proper speed to make the words recognizable. He explains that the aggregate vibration of the whole statue is based on its external shape, like atomic and molecular vibration. He points out that the formula for entropy, the measurement of the complexity of harmonic pattern, is the same as the formula for information theory, the measurement of the amount of information in a communication. Thus, a statue has high information value because its complex external shape gives it a high shape entropy and it communicates more meaning. This concept has implications for the communication values of modern v. classical art.",62cfdefb-9b9a-4039-980b-ef8048fb0c1b,bb3ea708-ba7c-47c7-81e7-e6041d1a11c8,,b13a7bd3-36ed-4838-a661-d2edd4c7924e,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins File 7 on March 22, 1959 from the studios of WJZ in Baltimore, Md.

In the seventh century BC, the Phoenicians circumnavigated Africa and may have sailed to the Azores and Canary Islands. They were followed by the Celts, who journeyed to Iceland and Greenland according to accounts by St. Brendan, who set sail from Ireland between 565-573 and encountered a crystal column in the sea, either an iceberg or glacier. He also possibly sailed to the Azores and Canaries and possibly to Mexico since Cortez discovered, in 1519, that the Aztecs celebrated a blend of paganism and Christianity and spoke of Quetzalcoatl, a legendary white priest. The Vikings or Norse also migrated to Iceland in 874. Around 900 they discovered Vitramannaland, or ""white man's land,"" possibly an Irish settlement in North America. In 930 Gunnbjorn discovered Greenland, and in 982 Erik the Red colonized it. Bjarni Herjulfsson, blown off course, explored part of the American coast unknowingly in 985. Leif Erikson also sailed along the shores of the American continent and established a colony named Vinland the Good, its exact location disputed. Other evidence of pre-Columbian Viking discovery includes maps and the existence of the stone Newport Tower in Rhode Island. Edmund Plowden referred to the tower in a 1632 petition, but this may have been elsewhere than Newport. Additional exploration included that of Giovanni da Verrazzano in 1524, the Venetian expedition in 1398 described in ""The Zeno Narrative"", and the Portuguese discovery of Newfoundland in 1450 and Labrador in 1492.",62cfdefb-9b9a-4039-980b-ef8048fb0c1b,bb3ea708-ba7c-47c7-81e7-e6041d1a11c8,,b13a7bd3-36ed-4838-a661-d2edd4c7924e,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins File 7 on April 26, 1959 from the studios of WJZ in Baltimore, Md.

He also explains how primitive man reckoned time, the Babylonian astrologers' influence, and the origins of sennight and fortnight. Words for the days of the week in French, Italian, and Anglo-Saxon reflect their origins in the Romans' naming of days for the moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, and the sun. Years can be considered as anomalistic, tropical, or sidereal. The tropical year is explained with a globe and photographer's lamp as the earth orbits around the sun from vernal equinox to vernal equinox every 365.2422 days, requiring a leap year day to catch up. Calendars based on the moon are soon out of sync with the seasons as they're based on the 29.5-day lunar month, which is why the dates of Passover and Easter fluctuate. Mr. Poole displays an American Indian lunar calendar drawn on buckskin for the period 1865-1892. Julius Caesar abandoned the lunar calendar and decreed that the year would run from vernal equinox to vernal equinox; however, by 1582 this Julian calendar was off by ten days, and Pope Gregory decreed the Gregorian calendar, still used today.",62cfdefb-9b9a-4039-980b-ef8048fb0c1b,bb3ea708-ba7c-47c7-81e7-e6041d1a11c8,,b13a7bd3-36ed-4838-a661-d2edd4c7924e,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins File 7 on December 27, 1959 from the studios of WJZ in Baltimore, Md.

Eisenhower introduces this program about the Fund for Adult Education, an independent philanthropic organization sponsored by the Ford Foundation to extend liberal education to adults. He explains that as a society becomes more complex, its need for good leaders increases. Charles H. Percy, president of the Bell and Howell Co. and chairman of the board for the Fund, describes leadership in the United States and public responsibility of its citizens. He points out that particularly because we now have the power to destroy ourselves, the future of society depends on the effectiveness of key people in organizations' leadership roles. The president of the Fund, C. Scott Fletcher, says that leadership comes from a multiple, fluid society, offering a constant supply of fresh people with new ideas. A short film shows how uneducated leaders in a village are unable to meet the challenge of change and take a long-range view. Harry A. Bullis, director of the Fund, explains that leadership training is available to Armed Forces staff and at most private organizations, but top government employees only receive on the job training via trial and error, often at the public's expense. The Fund intends to prepare such individuals for public responsibilities. President of Vassar College and vice-chair of the Fund's board Sarah Gibson Blanding describes leadership in Thomas Jefferson's days and how it developed as society became more complex. While there are opportunities for many types of training, adult leadership training is lacking. She reiterates that continuing liberal adult education is necessary. Leaders must be educated to be dedicated, courageous, and imaginative. Mr. Percy concludes that the threat of Soviet Russia and its success with communism will exist for a long time, so we must educate our leaders as efficiently as they do theirs. He suggests non-commercial educational television as a possible education vehicle.

Carl Jensen, a lighting engineer and marketing manager, and Dr. John McNall, the director of research at Westinghouse Electric Corp., discuss how this light is generated by exciting phosphors in alternating electric fields and demonstrate the concept using a tilting board with traps and marbles. Electro-luminescence was first discovered in 1936 by Georges Destriau, shown in a film clip. The guests also make the analogy of keys on a piano to the full electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to gamma waves. They explain that lumens are units of light and watts are units of power, and they compare the brightness of electro-luminescence to incandescent and fluorescent bulbs. The new product can become brighter by increasing the voltage or frequency or both, but it has limits. Dr. McNall shows the electrical conductors and other layers making up this artificial source of light and notes that it can be made into many shapes or designs and installed in ceilings, walls, stairs, furniture, and even drapery. However, square panels are the most common shape, as shown in the top of a coffee table and on the walls of a model room. Scientific use of electro-luminescence includes astronautical instrumentation, and electro-enhancement will lead to less x-ray exposure by intensification of fluoroscopy screens.

Dr. Lawrence Ross, associate professor of English at the Johns Hopkins University, argues that such modern trappings distort Shakespeare's work and Elizabethan times. He explains that the Shakespeare stage was an open air platform with emphasis on the actors and their speech and symbolized the order of the universe with man in the center. The same scene is then performed on the Folger Shakespeare Library's stage in Washington, DC in period costume. Dr. Ross says that Shakespeare's dramatic poetry spoken on the symbolic stage represented the essence of life and that the meanings of Elizabethan words often differed from current ones. Shakespeare's characters are hybrid: part real, part symbol, such as Shylock exacting a pound of flesh in the dramatized scene from ""The Merchant of Venice."" Dr. Ross analyzes a portrait of Queen Elizabeth as an introduction to the Elizabethan order of natural authority: the king ruled over the state, God over the universe, the sun over the planets, the husband over the family, and reason over man. Actors from Johns Hopkins Play Shop perform five passages from ""Macbeth"" as Dr. Ross explains the violation of the social, political, and natural worlds, evident in the words and their rhythms, when Macbeth and his wife contemplate and carry out the death of King Duncan.",62cfdefb-9b9a-4039-980b-ef8048fb0c1b,bb3ea708-ba7c-47c7-81e7-e6041d1a11c8,,b13a7bd3-36ed-4838-a661-d2edd4c7924e,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins File 7 on June 7, 1959 from the studios of WJZ in Baltimore, Md.

Lynn Poole shows a model of an early twentieth century satellite and notes its increasing importance in meteorology. Dr. George Benton, Johns Hopkins University professor of meteorology, displays a chart of satellites' distance above the earth's atmosphere and another chart of the electromagnetic spectrum. Dr. Sigmund Fritz, a meteorologist with the U.S. Weather Bureau, lists the advantages of a satellite in weather forecasting, including its high vantage point, rapid mobility, and broad coverage over the globe. Dr. William Kellogg, a meteorologist with the Rand Corp., describes the typical orbits of satellites launched from Cape Canaveral, explaining why an elliptical orbit is generally preferable, but a circular one is best for a weather satellite. He also says that the higher the satellite's elevation, the longer it will take to circle the earth but the longer the satellite's lifespan as well. Dr. Fritz stresses the technological problems that need to be overcome before satellites can become more useful tools: stabilization, to make it constantly look down; transmission, interpretation, and distribution of collected data; and measurement of cloud reflectivity. The satellites' benefits to meteorology will include wide range cloud detection, measurement of the heat balances that drive the storms, and measurement of radiation balance over land and water by latitude. Visuals include a time lapse film of gathering thunderclouds from the ground and 22 miles up, a photo of cloud cover over the entire eastern seaboard from 86 miles up, and an artistic rendition of how the earth might look from 4,000 miles up, by Harry Wexler of the U.S. Weather Bureau.",62cfdefb-9b9a-4039-980b-ef8048fb0c1b,bb3ea708-ba7c-47c7-81e7-e6041d1a11c8,,b13a7bd3-36ed-4838-a661-d2edd4c7924e,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins File 7 on May 3, 1959 from the studios of WJZ in Baltimore, Md.

Examples of elephant drawings made between 1500 B.C. and 500 A.D. in such diverse places as England, Ceylon, China, and Siam are often stylized or abstract whether the animal is native to the country or not. Similarly, a Greek coin displays an elephant likeness. However, during this period in Central America, Mayan statues, carvings, and writings and Aztec art and rituals distinctly show elephants even though there were none to copy nor anyone to describe them. Thus Dr. Carter maintains that Asian peoples must have brought drawings or statues of elephants to Central America over 2,000 years ago. The proof he offers for this theory is the Thor Heyerdahl transpacific raft voyage (proving such a trip could be made in a primitive vessel), identical temples 12,000 miles apart in Mexico and Cambodia, identical Sumatran and Mexican folding bark religious books, identical fishhooks from Easter Island and California, physical attributes of Central American and Asian Indians (photos show one of each, both playing nose flutes), and plants appearing in lands too far from original sources to have blown there.

He first describes, and displays, sculptures as artistic expressions existing in the round and being representational, semi-representational, or non-representational. He then argues that to understand the purpose of a sculpture, one must consider the culture that produced it and will generally find that it is either humanistic (making a statement about the human condition) or cult (serving as a bridge from this world to the next). As examples of cult objects, Mr. Myers exhibits the bronze head of the dead king of the kingdom of Benin in Nigeria. He also shows an Egyptian rose quartz sculpture of a pharaoh, an 8th century Indian temple corner graced by two dancers, a 14th century French Madonna and child, a second century Gandharan stucco head in the Roman tradition, and a 5th century sculpture similar to a Roman sarcophagus. To contrast humanistic examples of sculpture, Mr. Myers displays the remainder of a Greek Venus sculpture, the ideal of feminine beauty. The neo-humanism of Dante's era led to contemporary individualism as expressed in Maillol's 1898 ""Bather Fixing Her Hair,"" Degas' ""Little Dancer,"" and Matisse's ""Serf,"" ""Reclining Nude,"" and ""Serpentine."" He compares Renoir's 1916 bronze Venus to the ancient one and Henry Moore's abstract ""Reclining Woman"" with previous examples. Mr. Myers maintains that modern artists are the prophets and moralists of society and their return to abstract ideas and figures are a balance of otherworldliness and worldliness, with Venus and the dead king coalescing. He concludes the program showing two abstract metal sculptures: Giacometti's ""Man Pointing"" and Ibram Lassaw's ""Planets.""",62cfdefb-9b9a-4039-980b-ef8048fb0c1b,bb3ea708-ba7c-47c7-81e7-e6041d1a11c8,,b13a7bd3-36ed-4838-a661-d2edd4c7924e,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins File 7 on April 3, 1960 from the studios of WJZ in Baltimore, Md.

Using a chart, he explains the test for reactivity of the autonomic nervous system. Both attack and defense troops were measured before and after combat for hormone excretion, protein destruction, body salt retention, white blood cell count, and number of days to recover. Capt. Minard recommends using electronic transducers and transmitters to record such data in the future. Jean Taylor, an operations analyst with Johns Hopkins University, explains homeostasis (adjustments to protect the status quo) and the results of serious strains on it. Combatants were given paper and pencil tests to measure their higher mental functions and given a visual flicker fusion frequency test and an auditory flutter fusion frequency test to measure sensory cortical sensitivity. Ms. Taylor concludes that the physiological tests were more definitive than the psychological tests, which were inconclusive. Psychological stress was best observed through films shown of men before and after a combat that resulted in a 61% casualty rate.

In one greenhouse two groups of plants are receiving the same daytime conditions, but at night one is kept in total darkness while the other receives eight additional hours of incandescent light. Two four-year old loblolly pines show the results of this experiment. Dr. H. A. Borthwick explains that this is to study photoperiodism, or the effect of light on the plants' growth mechanism. In 1918 Wightman W. Garner and Harry A. Allard discovered that it is not the length of the day but rather of the night that is the determining factor in flower and seed production and growth of plants. Further experiments with lettuce, bean, tomato, and corn seeds test the effect of spectrum light colors and exposure on germination. A far red light creates a taller plant, and red light creates the tomato skin color. The mechanism in a plant the reacts to light is not chlorophyll but rather a two-way growth pigment, phytochrome, that acts as a switch with red and far red light. A film shows the process, using a spectrophotometer, by which this was determined. K. H. Norris demonstrates a spectrophotometer with a corn sample and explains the results with graphs. Two film clips show Sterling B. Hendricks doing further research on phytochromes to isolate their molecular structure and Soviet Prime Minister Nikita Khrushchev at Beltsville, MD listening to Dr. Borthwick discuss crop growth issues.",62cfdefb-9b9a-4039-980b-ef8048fb0c1b,bb3ea708-ba7c-47c7-81e7-e6041d1a11c8,,b13a7bd3-36ed-4838-a661-d2edd4c7924e,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins File 7 on February 14, 1960 from the studios of WJZ in Baltimore, Md.

Pictures reveal the sun's characteristics, such as sunspots, flares, and plages. A 1959 detailed photo of the sun taken with the Lyman alpha camera shows the Lyman alpha regions. Another film discusses the study of solar flares and the use of ""push button"" rocketry to measure them.

Mencken, opens this show on the ""Sage of Baltimore,"" and quotes him throughout the program. Lynn Poole gives a pictorial account of Mencken's early life. Dr. Carl Bode, University of Maryland English professor, discusses Mencken as a critic of literature, society, and politics. He points out Mencken's contentiousness in his writing, especially in political criticism, such as his comments in 1912 on Baltimore mayor James H. Preston. Although Mencken stood up for New Realists such as Dreiser and Hemingway, he disliked the pretentiousness of many authors of his day and spoke out against bestsellers with no literary merit. With Mr. Potter's assistance, Dr. Bode describes events in Mencken's career as editor and columnist with ""The Baltimore Sun"" newspaper, co-editor with George Jean Nathan of ""The Smart Set,"" editor and writer for ""The American Mercury,"" and author of numerous books, such as ""George Bernard Shaw"" and ""The American Language."" Mr. Potter dramatizes a portion of Mencken's obituary for William Jennings Bryan, written after Bryan's death following the 1925 Scopes Trial. In 1926 the Watch and Ward Society of Boston forced off the newsstands Mencken's controversial ""Hatrack"" story in ""The American Mercury,"" but Mencken prevailed. However, his unchanging views became trivial when he failed to recognize and understand the grave implications of the Great Depression or Hitler. Johns Hopkins professor emeritus Kemp Malone discusses Mencken's book ""The American Language,"" which posits that American English was so different from British English that it should have a separate name. As an amateur philologist, Mencken also launched ""American Speech,"" a learned journal, although he considered himself ""a scout for scholars,"" not a scholar himself. In conclusion, Lynn Poole recommends Mencken's ""A Carnival of Buncombe"" for additional reading.",62cfdefb-9b9a-4039-980b-ef8048fb0c1b,bb3ea708-ba7c-47c7-81e7-e6041d1a11c8,,b13a7bd3-36ed-4838-a661-d2edd4c7924e,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins File 7 on December 13, 1959 from the studios of WJZ in Baltimore, Md.

Dr. Edward Krieg, ham radio operator (W3CAY) and surgeon at Bon Secour Hospital in Baltimore, shows a film clip of a ham radio operators' ""field day"" and explains some of the ham radio lingo, such as ""CQ"" for hello and ""7-3"" for goodbye. He notes that some hams specialize in Morse code, a requirement for getting a radio license from the FCC. A film documents the DX (distance expedition) of six ham operators who sail to Navassa Island to set up a ham station (KC4AF) there. During the four days on the island, they made over 7,000 contacts in 75 different countries before going QRT (off the air). Another film shows the amateur ham operators' free emergency network to assist disaster organizations. Sam Harris' Rhododendron Swamp VHF Society of amateur ham experimenters is featured in another film clip. Perry Klein, a teenager credited with bouncing a signal off an artificial satellite, explains how he did it and plays a recording of the signal. He calls this form of communication ""high frequency satellite scatter"" or ""satellite bounce."" Klein recommends to viewers the book ""How to Become a Radio Amateur.""

Dr. Sanford Rosenthal, pharmacologist at the National Institute of Arthritis and Metabolic Diseases in Bethesda, MD, explains the emergency treatment he developed that is recommended in the dramatic scene: one teaspoon of salt plus half teaspoon of baking soda mixed in one quart of cool water and delivered orally to the burn victim at the rate of one quart per twenty pounds of body weight during the first 24 hours and half the amount during the next 24 hours. He explains that since 1942 National Institute of Health (NIH) has studied shock that follows severe injuries such as burns, crushing injuries, and hemorrhage. A film shows the procedure that replicated these types of injuries on female albino mice. Tissue fluid and blood rushing to the wound area result in dehydration, sodium deficiency, and reduced blood volume overall and can be corrected by administering Rosenthal's fluid treatment orally or intravenously. Dr. Kehl Markley, also of NIH, explains a chart comparing the amount of saline treatment to survival rate. He then narrates a film about 1951 experiments with human burn victims in Lima, Peru, where half received saline solution by mouth and half received plasma and glucose by vein. The two groups showed no significant differences after 24 hours, although many burn victims who survive the shock later die from infection. Dr. Markley discusses a chart of burn victims showing the number of deaths/cases of those who received saline, plasma, or both. In conclusion, the Office of Civil Defense Mobilization has recommended emergency use of saline solution for burn shock in case of a major bomb disaster.",62cfdefb-9b9a-4039-980b-ef8048fb0c1b,bb3ea708-ba7c-47c7-81e7-e6041d1a11c8,,b13a7bd3-36ed-4838-a661-d2edd4c7924e,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins File 7 on March 20, 1960 from the studios of WJZ in Baltimore, Md.

In it, Dr. George Carter, geography professor at Hopkins, notes that Louis S.B. Leakey found evidence of the earliest primitive man and his tools in Kenya. He then displays revised maps of the world that reveal different land masses during glacial periods, thus allowing the Kenyan man to explore new lands and form colonies over a period of 100,000 years until the glaciers receded and the oceans returned. Dr. Carter discusses the transformation of Kenyan man from an isolated pygmy into modern man with regional or racial characteristics, such as the cave dwelling ""Sinanthropus pekinesis"" in northern China and the Swanscombe man in England. Glacial periods also created a land bridge near the Bering Strait, allowing animals and man to cross from Asia into North America. Tools found in the Americas plus the physical characteristics of early American Indians offer proof of waves of Asian migrations. Survivors of early man include the australoids, europids, and mongoloids. At the conclusion of the program, host Lynn Poole thanks members of the studio, university, and network for their hard work and dedication. John McClay, general manager of station WJZ-TV, expresses his gratitude to Johns Hopkins University and Lynn Poole especially. University president Milton S. Eisenhower thanks everyone responsible for the shows and announces reluctantly that ""File 7"" will not be on the air next season. He says that the ""business of producing, creating, and presenting a weekly program has become increasingly burdensome,"" and because of the University's other commitments, it is unable to produce shows of the high quality expected of Johns Hopkins. Furthermore, Dr. Eisenhower hopes that this ""will be only an interruption and not a permanent termination"" of Hopkins educational television.

In 1837 Baltimore, Maryland painter Alfred Jacob Miller joined the American Fur Company caravan, with Scottish Captain William Drummond Stewart, to make a visual record of their trip to the fur traders' rendezvous in the Green River Valley of Wyoming. A map shows their route from Independence, Missouri to Oregon. Miller's sketches, later transformed into over 200 watercolors (now preserved in the Walters Art Gallery and displayed on this program) and oil paintings, chronicle such events as buffalo hunts, prairie fires, and river crossings, as well as such landmarks as Chimney Rock, Scott's Bluff, Fort Laramie, Independence Rock, and The Devil's Gate. Miller's paintings also show encounters with Sioux tribes and Black Feet Indians, various tribal members, and Indian women. The final painting shown portrays trapper Joe Walker with his new Indian wife heading into the wilderness after the rendezvous. Lynn Poole concludes the program by describing how missionaries such as Marcus and Narcissa Whitman took the Oregon Trail to Walla Walla, Washington, followed later by the many settlers moving West.",62cfdefb-9b9a-4039-980b-ef8048fb0c1b,bb3ea708-ba7c-47c7-81e7-e6041d1a11c8,,b13a7bd3-36ed-4838-a661-d2edd4c7924e,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins File 7 on May 15, 1960 from the studios of WJZ in Baltimore, Md.

To meet military demands for preserved foods during war, Nicholas Appert devised a method of preserving foods by heating them in sealed containers to destroy the bacteria. In 1812 Peter Durand invented the tin can and the first canning factory opened in Great Britain. A dramatization describes a typical 1815 dinner consisting predominantly of pickled, salted, smoked, and dried foods. Thomas Kensett patented Durand's tin cans in the U.S. in 1825. During the Civil War demands for canned foods increased, boosting mass production of the tin cans. Other products began appearing in cans, such as I. W. Lyons' tooth powder for home use; Gerhard Mennen's talcum powder for babies, in a lithographed can with a sprinkle top; and Gilbert Van Camp's pork and beans combination. A selection of 1880s mass produced, decorative tins display a variety of products, many non-perishable. Soldering the tops of cans by hand gave way to open-topped cans that could be seamed shut by machine. The only exception to this were condensed or evaporated milk cans, patented in 1856 by Gail Borden. A film shows a canning factory, producing 30,000 cans per hour, from cutting the tin plate to testing and shipping the final products. The aerosol can, first used in World War II for insecticide, is also discussed.",62cfdefb-9b9a-4039-980b-ef8048fb0c1b,bb3ea708-ba7c-47c7-81e7-e6041d1a11c8,,b13a7bd3-36ed-4838-a661-d2edd4c7924e,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins File 7 on April 24, 1960 from the studios of WJZ in Baltimore, Md.

Connolly outlines Project Transit, the first operational navigation satellite system for the use of submarines and surface vessels. He gives credit for this idea to Dr. William Guier and Dr. George Weiffenbach, of the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab (APL), who realized that after the launch of Russian Sputnik I they could track its position by observing the Sputnik's Doppler shift. Frank McClure, heard of research at APL, visualized that the opposite would then be true: a satellite in orbit could determine a point of reference on earth. Dr. Richard Kershner, former head of the Terrier surface to air missile program at APL, headed the designing and building of the Transit satellite. Dr. Kershner explains why the Doppler technique is highly accurate, and an animated segment simplifies this phenomenon. Using a chart and a mock up, Dr. Kershner describes the construction and sections of Transit I and how it functions, including its solar cells, radiation shield, and telemetering system. Film clips taken at APL show testing of weights on the satellite as well as the shake test, centrifuge test, and heat/cold tests. Additional film clips show the tracking stations, to monitor the satellite's received signals, in Maryland, New Mexico, and Texas, plus two mobile vans stationed in Washington and Newfoundland. Rear Admiral Connolly discusses the future of this project as it adds more satellites and notes that this television program is the first to reveal Project Transit, ""the practical navigational system of the future."" Host Lynn Poole concludes this twelfth anniversary program by pointing out that it is the oldest program on network television. He reminisces about the four stations on the network (Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York) when the first program premiered on March 9, 1948. Poole also shows clips from ""Fear,"" the oldest program kinescoped (October 3, 1950), the 1952 three-part series on outer space featuring Heinz Haber and Wernher Von Braun, and APL's Dr. Ralph E. Gibson's orbital shots of ""The World from 70 Miles Up"" (December 17, 1948). Poole quotes Isaiah Bowman, Johns Hopkins' president in 1948: ""Television is an exciting new medium by which we can extend the knowledge of a university beyond the confines of the classroom and the campus to those who are curious about the world in which they live.""",62cfdefb-9b9a-4039-980b-ef8048fb0c1b,bb3ea708-ba7c-47c7-81e7-e6041d1a11c8,,b13a7bd3-36ed-4838-a661-d2edd4c7924e,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins File 7 on March 6, 1960 from the studios of WJZ in Baltimore, Md.

Assistant director Dayton Carritt explains that the Institute was founded in 1948 to study the physical and chemical oceanography of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries and to conduct the academic program in oceanography at Johns Hopkins University. The Bay is 200 miles long, 20 miles wide, and a great natural resource for commercial and recreational users. Dr. Donald Pritchard, director of the Institute, shows viewers such below deck equipment as the pyrheliometer, which measures and records the intensity of solar radiation; and thetri-filter hydrophotometer, which measures the amount of red, green, and blue light that penetrates the various depths of the Bay and indicates the amount of energy in the water available for underwater plant growth. Using a schematic illustration, Dr. Carritt describes the environmental factors affecting plants and organisms in the Bay, such as water currents, temperature, and salinity as well as availability of plant food, oxygen, and animal life. Dick Whaley demonstrates a microscope mounted with a camera to study and record species of organisms such as diatoms. Other instruments read the salinity and temperature of the water, measure the angle of the current, and analyze the amount of dissolved oxygen in water for plant use. Scuba divers Tom Hopkins and Jim Carpenter discuss their apparatus and their Bell and Howell movie camera with underwater lens before going overboard to study the oyster and clam beds for predators and general condition. These are all examples of pure research on the Chesapeake Bay.",62cfdefb-9b9a-4039-980b-ef8048fb0c1b,bb3ea708-ba7c-47c7-81e7-e6041d1a11c8,,b13a7bd3-36ed-4838-a661-d2edd4c7924e,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins File 7 on June 2, 1957 from the deck of the laboratory ship ""Maury"" in the Chesapeake Bay.

Andrews and funded by Mrs. William Hale Harkness. Dr. Andrews hypothesizes that all matter is music since all matter in the universe vibrates, and tones and harmonies are made by vibrations. The motion of a plucked violin string and its adjacent string (sympathetic resonance) are shown in slow motion and on an oscilloscope. Dr. Andrews discusses one dimensional harmony, as described by Pythagoras. Two dimensional harmonies are indicated by the fractional overtones of a drum head membrane, which is shown in slow motion and heard electronically enhanced. Three dimensional harmonies result from the contraction and expansion of a sphere; however, differently shaped solids, such as statues, have fractional resonances that produce unique chords or harmonic patterns when vibrating. Four dimensional harmonies come from atom vibration, a wave whose harmonic pattern is displayed by a vibrating sphere. Thus, Dr. Andrews concludes that since an atom is not a particle that vibrates in space, but rather the vibration itself, all matter is in dynamic form or all matter is music. He continues by playing on a piano the chords of tones of atoms produced by different chemical compounds. He also shows and discusses the pattern of Bach's music on an oscilloscope and music composed by Rebekah West Harkness. In conclusion, Dr. Andrews discusses the dynamic form of the human body's symphony and its small chords in the larger universe.",62cfdefb-9b9a-4039-980b-ef8048fb0c1b,bb3ea708-ba7c-47c7-81e7-e6041d1a11c8,,b13a7bd3-36ed-4838-a661-d2edd4c7924e,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins File 7 on March 13, 1960 from the studios of WJZ in Baltimore, Md.

Eiseley, Provost of the University of Pennsylvania, lectures from material in his 1958 prize-winning book, ""Darwin's Century."" He explains why he teaches and how man's brain receives impressions and profits from experiences. He reads from Charles Darwin's ""Origin of Species"" as well as from Alfred Russel Wallace's work that recognizes man's brain as the totally new factor in the history of life. Man has the ability to invent, progress, and make changes in his surroundings; and man's ethics, arts, and religions determine his cruelty or humaneness. Dr. Eiseley notes that man is relatively young in the total history of life, but with his mechanical inventions and implements of war and power of choice for good or evil, man and his science have made humanity's extinction possible. Showing a chart of anthropoidal skulls of man's ancestors, Dr. Eiseley says the potential destiny of man is unknown. Because of the Cold War, we need to take responsibility now for spiritual greatness. He warns that man should not abandon or forget how he has always tried to transcend himself spiritually, and he quotes C. S. Lewis on the rationality of man.",62cfdefb-9b9a-4039-980b-ef8048fb0c1b,bb3ea708-ba7c-47c7-81e7-e6041d1a11c8,,b13a7bd3-36ed-4838-a661-d2edd4c7924e,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins File 7 on January 31, 1960 from the studios of WJZ in Baltimore, Md.

He discusses and gives examples of the five qualities of a perfect repellent: odorless, inexpensive, non-toxic, cosmetically acceptable, and effective for extended periods of time. Using a diagram of a blowfly's anatomy, Dr. Dethier explains how the flies are used in repellent research. Then using a series of actual flies, their wings waxed to sticks, Dr. Dethier puts the feet of the fly successively into sugar water, .01% glycol and sugar, and .1% glycol and sugar to observe the fly's reaction. The result is generally the average of a 100-fly test. Dr. Dethier then shows how one can predict the feasibility of some chemical compounds as repellents by their composition.

Lynn Poole describes the cramped conditions of a submarine crew and how they must be both physiologically and psychologically fit. Capt. Whelchel, from the Office of Chief Naval Operations, describes the disadvantages of a conventional submarine: inefficient design for operating beneath water, need to surface frequently to recharge batteries, and noise of its engines. He explains how the atomic submarine overcomes these inefficiencies.

Green, a senior physicist at Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island, N.Y., discusses the cosmotron, an atom smasher made possible by the Atomic Energy Commission and operated by nine universities, including Johns Hopkins. Mr. Green first explains that carbon atoms form charcoal and diamonds and that the nucleus of carbon consists of half neutrons and half protons. He then shows a model of a ring-shaped cyclotron, a slice of the magnet and vacuum chamber within, and a film of the actual machine in operation. A Van de Graaff generator, a particle accelerator, shoots protons into the vacuum chamber of the magnet, and they build up speed with each rotation up to 4 million revolutions per second. At 180,000 miles per second, the protons collide with a target resulting in mesons, medium weight particles. Mr. Green also shows a film of a cloud chamber in which atomic particles leave vapor trails.

The 75,000 precise ridges must be so accurately spaced that it requires a special machine to make a diffraction grating. Dr. Henry H. Rowland developed the first one in 1860, but Dr. John Strong refined this machine, the ruling engine, in 1950. Using a model of the machine, Dr. Strong explains the operation of a ruling engine, focusing on the perfect twin screws that are its vital parts. The maker of these screws, David Broadhead, of Wellsville, NY, demonstrates how one cuts one of these screws on a machine lathe. In a film, Wilbur Perry, one of the most accomplished mechanical and optical technicians in making diffraction gratings, constructs parts of the ruling engine, including the diamond used to cut the 75,000 grooves on the aluminum-coated glass.

The creation of a plan position indicator (PPI), or radar output display, made shipborne radar possible. In 1946, the minimum requirements for radar equipment were established at an international meeting in London. A year later, the international standard for marine radar, built to withstand sea-going conditions, was set. This navigational aid saves time, money, and often lives. A ship entering the harbor of St. John, New Brunswick, Canada is shown using radar to navigate in the fog.

Since sands and shoals shift, charts must be updated for accuracy. The echo sounder on shipboard takes depths continuously by sending out sound waves, which are reflected from the sea bottom back to the ship. This is used in conjunction with the sextant's measured angles of landmarks on shore to fix the exact position of the sounding. The triangulation procedure is explained and demonstrated on land, including the use of an astrolabe, chronometer, and chronograph true bearing of the triangulation framework. For triangulation at sea, floating beacons establish baselines, soundings are made, and chart datum of tides' heights for a lunar month is collected.

Dr. Eriksen later demonstrates that familiarity and experience can be used to overcome a fear. Dr. Shaw describes the difference between fear and caution and explains that fears are more likely to become pathological than other emotions. Phobias are irrational fears associated with specific objects, usually associated with an intense or unusual experience in childhood. Examples of typical phobias include acrophobia, claustrophobia, xylophobia, dromophobia, agoraphobia, monophobia, zoophobia, ailurophobia, topophobia, and myctophobia.

Telescopic views of Mars are unclear and photographs are difficult to make; however, polar caps have been seen and their changing size suggests seasons on the planet. The Dutch astronomer Christian Huyghens sketched Mars with continents and oceans, but his view has been disproved.

Lynn Poole shows the ingredients of glass: silica, soda, and lime. Dr. Davies, of the Mellon Institute, discusses the states of matter, focusing on solids. He then explains the random structure of glass and why lenses are made from this substance. Using a petrographic microscope, Dr. Davies shows three samples of glass fibers under both ordinary and polarized light. He notes that because the density of glass varies with temperature and within the same piece of glass, it breaks under pressure. He hammers squares of regular and tempered glass to show the difference in their shattering. Dr. Davies also demonstrates the chemical resistivity of glass and explains that because glass is a versatile solvent, it can be used to make such products as goggles for glassblowers.

He notes that ""Portland"" is not a trade name for cement but rather a standard cement powder formula named by an English bricklayer in 1824 for the isle of Portland. The Romans used concrete, made from Mt. Vesuvius's volcanic rock and sand, to construct many of their famous buildings. Mixing concrete is compared to following a recipe since measurement is critical. Furthermore, the chemistry of concrete is such that it requires moisture for 7-10 days to properly harden. Dr. Boyer enumerates the versatility of concrete and shows how pre-casting concrete of precise forms speeds up construction. He then discusses concrete use in bridge building. Because concrete is strong in compression but relatively weak in tensile strength, reinforced concrete with embedded steel was developed in 1850, and pre-stressed concrete, held in a permanent squeeze with steel wires and bars, is now used in bridges and many other applications.",62cfdefb-9b9a-4039-980b-ef8048fb0c1b,bb3ea708-ba7c-47c7-81e7-e6041d1a11c8,,b13a7bd3-36ed-4838-a661-d2edd4c7924e,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins science review on February 17, 1954 from the studios of WAAM in Baltimore, Md.

In the 15th century, the Branca family developed techniques for other facial reconstruction, called the Italian method, shown in diagrams. Gaspare Tagliacozzi, the true father of plastic surgery, wrote a textbook on the subject in the 16th century. Carl von Graefe was the first to use the term ""plastic"" in his 1818 work Rinoplastik. Johns Hopkins University's Dr. John Staige Davis published the first American textbook on plastic surgery and established the first formal training program in the specialty. In discussing modern plastic surgery, Dr. Edgerton notes that it is not necessarily centered on the face or visible external features. Common uses of plastic surgery are to correct congenital deformities, such as cleft palette; burns; disease, such as cancer; and disfigurement from war or high speed accidents.",62cfdefb-9b9a-4039-980b-ef8048fb0c1b,bb3ea708-ba7c-47c7-81e7-e6041d1a11c8,,b13a7bd3-36ed-4838-a661-d2edd4c7924e,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins science review on September 16, 1953.

Words can be symbols also. Latin, although not spoken today as a living language is still used in scientific communication. Latin began as the language of Rome and its vicinity, but through many conquests the Romans spread the use of Latin to the rest of Italy and what is now France, Spain, and North Africa. The Romans also conquered Greece, but since Green was also a highly developed literary language, the Greeks retained their own language. Latin also became the language of the Roman Catholic Church and medieval universities. Many scientific discoveries made during the Renaissance and the early modern period were given names in Latin. Even today Latin names such as Zea mays (corn) are used in scientific communication. Carl von Linné or Carolus Linneaus in Latin classified life forms in an orderly way using Latin terms. In his classification of kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus and species, a dog would be animal, chordata, mammalia, carnivora, canidae, canis familiarus. The Babylonians were fond of the number 60, which is retained today in 60 seconds in a minute, and 60 minutes in an hour, and even 360 degrees in a circle, which is 6 times 60.

A film by the U.S. Dept. of Interior then shows the historical use of the Colorado River. In the late 1800s, Thomas Blythe acquired 40,000 acres in Palo Verde Valley, California and filed the first water rights to the river. In 1867 Jack Swilling built the first irrigation canals in Arizona. By diverting water from the river to land, the southwest began to thrive. However, floods, such as the one that created Salton Sea in 1905, alternating with droughts required a plan to stabilize the flow of the Colorado. Arthur Powell Davis, Director of the U. S. Reclamation Service, proposed a dam, and the Boulder Canyon Project Act was passed in 1928. In 1931 dam construction was begun in Black Canyon, and Hoover Dam (called Boulder Dam from 1933-1946) was completed in 1936, two years ahead of schedule. The resulting Lake Mead, named in honor of U. S. Reclamation Commissioner Dr. Elwood Mead, extends over 100 miles upstream, can hold 2 years of flow from the Colorado River, and has become a very popular recreation area for water sports.",62cfdefb-9b9a-4039-980b-ef8048fb0c1b,bb3ea708-ba7c-47c7-81e7-e6041d1a11c8,,b13a7bd3-36ed-4838-a661-d2edd4c7924e,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins science review on August 5, 1954 from the studios of WAAM in Baltimore, Md.

Skin, covering approximately 18 square feet, is a human's largest organ and serves as the body's protection. Using both live animals from the Baltimore Zoo and representations of animals, Dr. Sullivan explains their protective mechanisms: the lizard's skin changes color for camouflage; the duck's preen gland maintains its feathers with a precursor of vitamin D; the rat's sebaceous glands repel lice; the lion's mane protects it from other animals' bites; and a turtle's shell, a porcupine's quills, and a pachyderm's thick skin all protect the animal within. Dr. Sullivan draws a diagram of the layers of human skin, stressing the epidermis and protective barrier that prevents water from penetrating skin. He notes that a frog has no transitional layer, so its skin can take up water. The human sweat glands continuously secrete a wet film on the skin. The sebaceous glands secrete sebum, which contains two emulsifiers that allow the skin to sweat.",62cfdefb-9b9a-4039-980b-ef8048fb0c1b,bb3ea708-ba7c-47c7-81e7-e6041d1a11c8,,b13a7bd3-36ed-4838-a661-d2edd4c7924e,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins science review on October 3, 1954 from the studios of WAAM in Baltimore, Md.

During the Old Stone Age, men hunted wild animals with crudely made tools and lived in caves. When the ice receded in the New Stone Age, the environment and geography of Great Britain was much changed, and men became farmers. Archaeologists interpret this history based on findings at such sites as the Windmill Hill settlement in the U. K., which has yielded the earliest examples of British pottery. Scenes from Skara Brae in the Orkney Islands show the extensive remains of this prehistoric village preserved by blowing sand dunes.

He says that of the two major milk cow groups, the European cattle offer high milk production but low resistance to a hot environment and the native Indian humped cattle are the opposite. In addition to breeding the most heat resistant European cows and selecting the native cattle with the highest milk production for breeding, the Dept. of Agriculture is cross breeding Jersey cows and Sindhi cows. The research results seem to show that a cow that is 5/8 native Sindhi has the best combination of heat tolerance and milk production. In a film of the heat room, Mr. McDowell explains experiments which measure the cows' sweat and their respiratory cooling. He also notes that the color and thickness of a cow's coat and its blood flow to the skin are possible determinants in heat adaptation.",62cfdefb-9b9a-4039-980b-ef8048fb0c1b,bb3ea708-ba7c-47c7-81e7-e6041d1a11c8,,b13a7bd3-36ed-4838-a661-d2edd4c7924e,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins science review on September 5, 1954 from the studios of WAAM in Baltimore, Md.

However, most telephone services have large power plants and storage batteries, which function when no light is available, so there is no reason to substitute a solar battery. Dr. Strieby next demonstrates a ""personalized telephone"" prototype (""like Dick Tracey's""), which functions like a mini-FM broadcasting station using transistors activated by a solar battery. This is only experimental and short-range because of the length of antenna required to transmit beyond a few hundred feet.

This program is the first in a three-part series on peacetime uses of atomic energy. A brief animated film reviews such concepts as neutrons and protons in a nucleus surrounded by electrons. There are 92 kinds of naturally occurring atoms, and changes can only be made to an atom by altering its nucleus. When the nucleus is split, it gives off energy. Mr. Strauss, the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), cites President Eisenhower's 1953 ""Atoms for Peace"" speech to the United Nations in which he suggests a world pool of atomic materials for peaceful uses, such as commercial electrical power.

An animated film shows the differences in size, shape, and stability of various atoms, the unstable ones being labelled radioactive isotopes. Dr. Bugher, of the Atomic Energy Commission, claims that the use of nuclear energy has advanced medicine by 25 years. For example, radioactive isotopes can be used to study the actual functioning and behavior of plants and animals, to trace and diagnose diseases such as thyroid problems, and to treat and cure diseases such as polycythemia, a form of cancer. He also demonstrates a thulium x-ray unit and narrates a short film showing cobalt-60 radiation of a patient with cancer. Gamma radiation is compact, reliable, and intense.

This is the first public showing and demonstration of a combination of x-ray photography and fluoroscopy picked up by a television receiving tube, affording both dynamic and clear internal views of patients. The equipment was constructed at The Johns Hopkins University with funds from the U.S. Public Health Service and developed by Dr. Russell H. Morgan. Dr. Morgan shows and explains the dim images of a standard fluoroscope and the static x-rays of a chest, colon, and kidney produced on a radiographic table to compare the strengths and weaknesses of each procedure. With physicist Ralph Sterm at the controls and assisted by Vernon Bowers, Ed Custer, and Roy Collier, Dr. Morgan then demonstrates his new invention, which amplifies images 300-3,000 times, and x-rays the movement of the chest and hand of Joan Hunter for viewers to see. Finally, in the first live television, inter-city diagnosis, Dr. Paul C. Hodges, at the University of Chicago, and Dr. Waldron Sennott, at the U.S. Marine Hospital in New York, observe the x-ray/fluoroscopy images broadcast on their televisions and consult with Dr. David Gould, at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, and together diagnose and prescribe treatment for a patient, machine operator James Carter, who has metal particles clearly lodged in his chest and possibly his lungs.",62cfdefb-9b9a-4039-980b-ef8048fb0c1b,bb3ea708-ba7c-47c7-81e7-e6041d1a11c8,,b13a7bd3-36ed-4838-a661-d2edd4c7924e,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins science review on December 5, 1950 from the studios of WAAM in Baltimore, Md.

Baltimore Polytechnic Institute teacher Malcolm Davies proves that perpetual motion does not exist. The device purporting it is actually a Crookes' radiometer that merely demonstrates the facts of radiation. Davies then discusses the navigational issues confronting Columbus and his sailors, such as the differences in distances from the magnetic poles to the actual poles and the strength of the tradewinds. Poole exhibits a copy of ""The Story of Maps"", written by Peabody librarian Lloyd A. Brown, which mentions an astrolabe, like that used by Columbus. Davies displays an astrolabe and shows how it's used in conjunction with the north star for navigation. He also demonstrates Gunter's quadrant and a marine sextant. The camera views through the sextant eyepiece as Davies makes adjustments, allowing viewers to experience its operation. Finally, using several examples, Davies explains Bernoulli's Principle, which occurs when vehicles at high velocity pass on roads and atmospheric pressure appears to push them together.

Dr. Harry F. Klinefelter, of the Johns Hopkins Hospital, explains charts showing the mechanical, metabolic, degenerative, and psychological complications of obesity as well as the issues of decreased life expectancy, malignant disease (cancer), and cirrhosis of the liver. He points out that the basic problem is overeating, or taking in more calories than the body requires for energy. However, since the basal metabolism and average daily metabolism varies by person, two people of similar build may have quite different food requirements. Dr. Klinefelter compares people to cars of similar size that get different mileage due to variations in their engine construction and design. He displays average height and weight tables, which don't consider body build and bone structure, and thus are merely guidelines. Dr. Eugene Meyer, psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins, discusses the psychological factors in weight reduction. Compulsive eating begins when one habitually seeks comfort and satisfaction through eating, creating the cycle described by Dr. Hilde Bruch. This pattern may also begin by filling a sense of loss or emptiness with food or by mothers habitually consoling a child with food. Dr. Klinefelter explains that for weight reduction fat must be metabolically burned. Massage and strenuous exercise are both ineffectual in doing this. Since losing more than two pounds per week is dangerous, Dr. Klinefelter recommends a long-term balanced diet, limiting high calorie foods such as bread, potatoes, butter, and cereal and eliminating sweets.

An explanation of temperature inversions shows how they can produce optical mirages by reflected sunlight, and Menzel's lab experiment reproduces this phenomenon. Lynn Poole shows viewers a home experiment to simulate the gradual bending of reflections to make them appear as mirages. A film shows another explanation of flying saucers, offered by Noel Scott, Army physicist.

William A. Dayton, chief of the Division of Dendrology for the U.S. Forest Service, recounts the superstitions and myths about poisonous plants and notes allusions to them in the Bible and in Shakespeare's works. He shows sketches of two groups of particularly virulent plants: water hemlocks and amanitas mushrooms. Mr. Dayton says that there are more than 500 species of poisonous plants in the United States, and some cause the loss of 4% of livestock each year. Two such classes of plants are the alkaloids, which contain nitrogen, and the glycosides, which produce prussic acid. He shows photos of toxic plant specimens and their reactions when ingested by animals. Cattle are susceptible to larkspur and St. John's wort; sheep to pingue, lupine, horsebrush, and halogeton; horses to locoweed and death camas.

According to the report, the projected 1975 demand for raw materials will be an increase of 64%. A chart compares consumption of raw materials in 1900, 1950, and 1975 and the resulting production surpluses and deficits. Dr. Arnold C. Harberger, Johns Hopkins University economist and staff consultant on the Commission, explains how projections on zinc and steel demands are calculated. He assumes that although the 1975 GNP will be twice that of 1950, demand for many goods, such as automobiles and televisions, won't grow at the same rate. A chart shows the general demands of all natural resources in 1975. Harberger says that to meet these demands, the Commission recommends efficient production of coal and petroleum, geological surveys of the United States, and mass production of such new materials as tantalum and germanium.

Holliday displays a still camera, installed in two rockets, that photographed one picture every two seconds of the upper atmosphere. Several photos from 70 miles up create a 1,400-mile panorama of the U.S. southwest. The camera is justified as a means to determine the rocket's position in space for properly reading data, to obtain meteorological data, and to perform long-range reconnaissance. Holliday also developed a 35 mm. motion picture camera that records views on either side of the rocket. He displays the internal workings of the movie camera in operation, a lens from the camera, and a motion picture taken by the camera.

Brodel subsequently founded the Department of Art as Applied to Medicine at The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. Annette Burgess, medical illustrator at the Hopkins Wilmer Eye Clinic, demonstrates a slit lamp to examine the iris and cornea of the eye and then sketches them. She also uses an ophthalmoscope to see problems with the eye's retina. The drawings she displays are often used as teaching tools. Leon Schlossberg, of the medical arts staff, sketches the heart of a blue baby for use in medical journals and textbooks and shows an illustration of fetal circulation drawn for a pharmaceutical company.

Lynn Poole honors the scientists currently attending the 90th annual meeting of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), presided over by Johns Hopkins University's president, Detlev Bronk. Poole describes highlights in the history of the organization, such as Congress' legalization of use of the metric system in 1866 and creation of the U.S. Forest Service in 1896, both based on recommendations of NAS. In 1916 NAS established the National Research Council, and through the efforts of its first chairman, George Ellery Hale, and Dr. Robert A. Millikan, President Woodrow Wilson requested NAS to perpetuate the Council. The remainder of the program explains and demonstrates misconceptions about scientific facts: a copper penny can not substitute for a burned out fuse; small flies are not offspring of large flies (houseflies, blow flies, and stable flies are all in their adult stages); spontaneous generation of rags into mice or horse hair into worms does not occur; people can not be hypnotized against their will; frozen body parts should not be rubbed with snow; ice does not make anything near it very cold (as an experiment with liquid nitrogen shows); water will not put out any fire (water on potassium will start a fire); oysters are also edible in months not containing ""r""; mentally ill people can be cured; and mothers do not ""mark"" their babies before birth. Lynn Poole concludes the program by asking viewers to send him their requests for previous programs they would like repeated in June.",62cfdefb-9b9a-4039-980b-ef8048fb0c1b,bb3ea708-ba7c-47c7-81e7-e6041d1a11c8,,b13a7bd3-36ed-4838-a661-d2edd4c7924e,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins science review on April 29, 1953 from the studios of WAAM in Baltimore, Md.

Man has wondered about the universe around him since prehistoric times, noticing the movement of the stars and planets. Early in the 20th century the Zeiss planetarium was developed and built in six cities in the United States. After World War II, Armand Spitz produced the Spitz planetarium which made it much more economical for smaller sites to have planetariums. There are now over one hundred in the United States. Mr. Spitz discusses how these planetariums work. He has also designed a toy planetarium that can project images of the stars and planets in the home.",62cfdefb-9b9a-4039-980b-ef8048fb0c1b,bb3ea708-ba7c-47c7-81e7-e6041d1a11c8,,b13a7bd3-36ed-4838-a661-d2edd4c7924e,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins science review on September 19, 1954 from the studios of WAAM in Baltimore, Md.
