In 1900 only sixteen kinds of metal were used by American industry, but at the time of this program, there are 321 known metals and alloys. Lynn Poole shows a piece of a new metal, Fiberfrax, that doesn't get hot when heated. Dr. Maddin, associate professor of metallurgy at Johns Hopkins University, discusses the inside of metal and shows a model of atoms in a perfect metal and one with deviations or imperfections. Mr. Poole notes that only 460 metallurgists are being trained in 45 colleges each year but at least three times that number are needed each year for the next ten years. Dr. Hollomon, head of the metallurgy and ceramic research division of General Electric (GE), lists common metal products and discusses how metals, such as titanium alloys, must be made stronger to withstand the higher temperatures occurring at faster jet speeds and to solve the problem of fractured pipelines and ships. There are career opportunities for chemist metallurgists, involving ingots and arch melting; process metallurgists, researching the forces in metals; development metallurgists, testing stresses and corrosion of metals; and research metallurgists, looking inside metals. Dr. Hollomon recommends studying math, physics, and chemistry in high school to begin the path to becoming a metallurgist.

Willis Gore, Johns Hopkins University assistant professor of electrical engineering, points out that an engineer both creates or invents and operates what he has produced. He uses a servosystem to demonstrate two branches of electric engineering: communications (electronics) and power (generation and utilization of power). Thomas Trice, superintendent of electrical operations of Baltimore Gas and Electric, says that electrical engineering has emerged as a leading profession as electrical demand has increased dramatically since 1910. A film of the electrical planning process stresses reliability of service, safety, and cost of a design. An electrical power analyzer is shown and explained as are meters and relays designed for accuracy and dependability at the Herbert A. Wagner electric generating station in Baltimore. Another film follows the generation of electricity from the coal pile through an electrical power plant and over wires to various customers. George Bisset, senior vice president of Potomac Electric Power Co. in Washington, DC, discusses the shortage of electrical engineers, noting that atomic energy will not replace electrical energy, and that use will at least double every ten years.

Dr. Iler, research manager of the Grasselli Chemical Dept. at E. I. duPont de Nemours and Co., defines chemistry and chemical reactions and lists everyday products created from chemical reactions. In agriculture, fertilizers, insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, and feed supplements for livestock and poultry are all chemical creations. The process to develop a new product involves organic chemists; physical chemists; analytical chemists; biologists; chemical, mechanical, and electrical engineers; and often soil chemists and biochemists. A film shows how research results applied to farm production result in greater output with less labor. The goal of agricultural research chemists is to create new knowledge, processes, and products, and improve present ones, for plants and animals. Dr. Iler notes that 90% of all chemicals tested are inadequate. He then explains the steps required to test a new fungicide chemical, beginning with making the chemicals easily mixable with water for spraying on plants and ending with analysis of the resulting fruit with a colorimeter to test for chemical absorption. He also briefly comments on chemicals in cattle dips and sprays to control insects and parasites on livestock.

He also shows photographs of archaeological sites in Oregon yielding 10,000-30,000 year-old fossils as well as Folsom man projectile points found in New Mexico.

Three men at different points in their medical education each list their increasing responsibilities. John Freese, a third year medical student, says that one must enjoy science, have stamina, and be able to deal with people to survive medical school. James Allen, an intern in medicine at Johns Hopkins, describes his duties and adds that doctors need to deal compassionately with relatives of patients as well as with the patients themselves. William Knauer, a resident in ophthalmology, has been studying medicine for twelve years and describes his responsibilities at the Johns Hopkins Wilmer Eye Clinic. Mr. Poole also introduces and interviews the wives of these men, who agree that their role is to be understanding of a doctor's time and situation and to have something at home to keep them busy and happy.",Public digital access,Science Review,,Copyright Not Evaluated,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Tomorrow's careers on April 24, 1956 from the studios of WAAM in Baltimore, Md.

Guest Gene Bordinat, vice president of Ford Motor Co. in charge of styling and assistant to George W. Walker, is the chief designer of the Mercury. He explains that in designing a car, he must consider not only what the American public wants but also management's bottom line, since a complete body and chassis change costs the company $75 million. Because of automotive competition, Bordinat can not show forthcoming models, but he does display some ""dream cars,"" such as the XM Turnpike Cruiser and the Taj Mahal, which are impractical to produce but which offer design features applicable to practical cars. He enumerates the steps in creating new models from design to production, including engineering, manufacturing, financing, and safety considerations. A film shows the Ford assembly line and testing labs. Bordinat shows a typical 3/8 scale clay model of the XM Turnpike Cruiser and discusses its design features and proportions. His design ideas come from observing various shapes, and he applies them to auto styling, such as elements of a B-52 bomber appearing as impact units (bumpers) on the Cruiser.

Colonel Mason, a graduate of Harvard and student of John Gallishaw, is the author of numerous historical novels and juvenile books, some translated into 18 languages. He maintains that waiting for inspiration is nonsense and that the writer should keep regular hours. His method of composition is to dictate his stories to a secretary who transcribes the drafts on yellow, then blue, then white paper. Colonel Mason explains that the two types of novels are stories of accomplishment and stories of decision. The elements of any story should include who, when, where, and how and should create urgencies or crises, as his impromptu story exemplifies. He describes his travels and research for his most recently published book, Silver Leopard, about the First Crusade, and displays his research notebook for his current work, Our Valiant Few, about the Civil War. His advice to young writers is to study with a competent teacher, write daily, don't quit your job after selling your first story, and remember that writing is more perspiration than inspiration. The second guest, Holmes Alexander, studied and wrote at Princeton and Cambridge. He then taught writing at the McDonough School, a private Baltimore school, and wrote book reviews and other pieces. When he was elected to the Maryland legislature, he wrote about his campaign and sold the story to Harpers. After that he became a reporter with The Baltimore Sun, covering county politics and Johns Hopkins University. He wrote biographies of Martin Van Buren and Aaron Burr as well as other books, nonfiction articles on horses, and fictional baseball stories, which he sold to such magazines as Saturday Evening Post, Colliers, and Esquire. He became Kiplinger's senior editor and ultimately a syndicated columnist. His advice to aspiring writers is to go where the trouble is to get the news, be able to write anywhere, and ignore obstacles to writing. A party at the end of this program celebrates the eighth year of Johns Hopkins programs with WAAM and the first anniversary of ""Tomorrow's Careers."" Herbert Cahan hosts the party, Mrs. Kennard Calfee presents the cake, and Lynn Poole introduces the staff. In addition to those normally appearing in the credits, he includes Dick Zibner (new assistant producer), Andy Bevins (floor manager), John Stokes and Allen Holmes (cameramen), and mentions Herman and Ben Cohen (of WAAM Network) and John Charles Daly (of ABC).",Public digital access,Science Review,,Copyright Not Evaluated,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Tomorrow's careers on March 6, 1956 from the studios of WAAM in Baltimore, Md.

Diagnosis sometimes depends of laboratory aids to confirm clinical impressions. Microscopic changes can be recognized to help determine the management and treatment of dermatoses. The understanding of the physiology of the skin and the diagnosis of skin conditions and diseases are necessary for the dermatologist. Treatment methods are more diversified than in any other medical specialty. There are internal medications such as anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-histamines, hormones, sedatives and injectable medications. Topical therapy uses lotions, ointments, soaps, and compresses. Other treatments include physical therapy, ultraviolet light, x-ray and radium therapy, cryotherapy, and surgery. The influence of professors and teachers is very important in guiding students into the various aspects of medicine. In fact the teachers must be constantly learning as post-graduates to keep up with the latest developments to stay in touch with their students.

A film shows Dr. Russell S. Fisher, lecturer in forensic medicine at Johns Hopkins University and chief medical examiner for the state of Maryland, at work in his lab. He is assisted by a team consisting of a secretary, chemists, a photographic specialist, doctors, police, and specialists in the physical sciences. In dealing with crimes of violence or mysterious death, Dr. Fisher asks: Who is the victim? Is it murder or suicide? When did it happen? How did it happen? Who did it? He shows a photo of a charred body and explains when and how the death occurred and the importance of an autopsy and a post-mortem examination. Dr. Fisher compares blood samples and explains how they are used by a courtroom doctor to exonerate or convict the accused. Using sketches from Lynn Poole's book ""Science, the Super Sleuth,"" Dr. Fisher describes what he looks for in knifing murders. He also tells the case of the arsenic in the pancake flour and demonstrates how the presence of arsenic was confirmed. Lynn Poole shows snapshots of Dr. Fisher as a student in the toxicology lab at Georgia Tech as well as photos from throughout his career in forensic medicine. Dr. Fisher says that this career is different and challenging every day and that there are many opportunities for medical examiners and other trained specialists, with salaries from $17,000-20,000.",Public digital access,Science Review,,Copyright Not Evaluated,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Tomorrow's careers on October 8, 1955 from the studios of WAAM in Baltimore, Md.

Dr. Russell Morgan, Director of Radiology Dept. at Johns Hopkins University, fields questions from members of the press: Nate Hazeltine, a ""Washington Post"" science writer; Pare Lorentz, a film producer; and Earl Ubell, a reporter and science editor with the ""New York Herald Tribune"". Dr. Morgan explains that x-rays affect both individual cells and the whole body, making them more susceptible to premature aging. He discusses the research by John Lawrence on the effects of radiation on mice and their extrapolation to man. He also notes a study on radiation vs. non-radiation workers that showed no difference in life spans of the two groups. It is the amount of radiation exposure that determines the effects of the damage. For example, a chest x-ray only delivers about 1/20th roentgen, a unit of radiation. However, Dr. Morgan discusses the feasibility of a reporting system for patients' total x-ray exposure and the need for a set of standards. And he does admit that the complexity and amount of radiation exposure is increasing in diagnostic studies and could double by 1960-65. A film clip demonstrates that this radiation exposure can be reduced by filtration, distance from the x-ray machine, length of time of exposure, and protection of areas not being radiated. Mr. Poole points out that Dr. Morgan has developed a fluoroscopy machine reducing by up to ten times the radiation time. In conclusion, Dr. Morgan discusses whether the Atomic Energy Commission or the U. S.

Dr. Walter Driscoll, director of research at Baird-Atomic Inc., then shows a chart of the electromagnetic spectrum and notes that while x-rays yield only shadowy pictures and radar waves detect but don't create pictures, germanium and silicon filters block radiated energy and allow infrared light to pass through to form an image. Dr. Driscoll displays a scanning bolometer, which can see in the dark, but the shapes it creates need to be interpreted. He also shows a snooperscope and a film clip of a sniperscope with infrared scope. Previous research on infrared or thermal detection was done by Sir John Frederick William Herschel. Potter Trainer demonstrates and explains the Evaporagraph (EVA), which is based on the principle that all things radiate heat as infrared rays, and shows some of the actual pictures made from heat rather than light. Dr. Walter Baird describes applications of EVA to industry, such as detecting problem-causing hot spots in electronic equipment or indicating heat escape or insulation deficiency in a building. EVA's resolution is 10 lines/mm at best, and it shows temperature contrast of .2 degree. The machine's weakness is the slow speed of response to small temperature differences and the inability to obtain the temperature scale of the item viewed.

Lynn Poole discusses increasing U. S. energy needs and predicts that the world may run out of coal in 1000 years and oil in 100 years, making solar energy a critical commodity. A film clip shows the sun's surface and its energy generation is discussed. John Yellott, executive director for the Association for Applied Solar Energy, says that space heating will be the first large use of solar energy. He explains the workings of a solar-heated house with auxiliary heat pump designed by University of Minnesota architecture student Peter Lee and engineered by Bridgers and Paxton. According to Mr. Yellot, the basic instruments of solar energy are collectors, concentrators, photoelectricity, and photochemistry. He shows how solar stills can convert salt water into fresh; solar furnaces can be used for metallurgy and other research; and solar stoves can be designed for arid countries where fuel is scarce. Mr. Poole uses a photo flood light to light a cigarette and shows how selenium cells operate a photoelectric exposure meter and 8mm movie camera. Mr. Yellott demonstrates a radio/phonograph developed by Admiral Corp. to run on solar cells with backup storage batteries.

Dr. Donald Andrews, chemistry professor at Johns Hopkins University, says that man has learned how to harness and control the atom's energy in such projects as atomic submarines and power plants, but we can not yet harness or control hydrogen, the newest source of nuclear power. To do that, machines need to supplement man's brain, offering ""automatic control"" or cybernetics. Examples of this include analog machines that regulate single functions, like James Watts' fly ball governor to control steam to the engine (demonstrated in animated film), thermostats that work on a feedback loop, servoengines that correct the course of a ship, and automated pilots on planes. Dr. Andrews then demonstrates thermodynamics, which studies the relations between heat and motion, and shows visible and audible evidence of a gas using dry ice. He defines entropy as the degree of randomness in a situation expressed by probabilities. Claude Shannon was the first person to see the parallel between entropy and the theory of information, which makes possible more complex automatic control devices. Self-regulating machines still need human monitoring, but digital information machines, or computers, can handle more complex situations, such as reacting to emergencies. A filmed narrative describes IBM's Model 705 equipment and statistics. Dr. Andrews says that computers will become the instruments of overall control. Cartoons show the statistics, promises, and fears of mechanization in business, industry, and government, concluding that by 1965, the United States, with a population of 190,000,000 will require a 50% increase in production. Dr. Andrews also predicts that in the future automatic control machines will make possible automatically steered cars, continuous television with an on-request program selector for shows in full color and 3-D, interplanetary transportation within 100 years, and modification of conditions on other planets by robots for colonization of space. The program concludes with a brief film of the launching of an artificial earth satellite placed in orbit by a three-stage rocket as America's contribution to the 1957-58 International Geophysical Year.",Public digital access,Science Review,,Copyright Not Evaluated,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins File 7 on January 6, 1957 from the studios of WAAM in Baltimore, Md.

Dr. William A. McDonald, assistant director of the Baltimore Museum of Art, explains the artist's creative process. He compares naturalism vs. emotional reaction to a subject by comparing two paintings of cats. Artists may distort form, color, or size to emphasize qualities that are important. Both artists and sculptors use horizontal lines to express serenity and diagonal or curved lines for movement, as exemplified in the dance movements of a Kirchner painting and a Matisse sculpture. Dr. McDonald discusses the heavy black lines, borrowed from stained glass making, in Georges Rouault's ""The Crucifixion,"" and the swirling lines in Vincent Van Gogh's ""Starry Night,"" an example of expressionism. The German expressionists were influenced by the abstract art of Africa and used lines to evoke inner feelings. Displayed examples of this school include a Pechstein woodcut, a Kathe Kollwitz drawing, a Heckel self-portrait, and Miro's happier painting ""Summer.""

Investigating the interior of bones, Dr. Montagna shows the frontal sinuses of the head and compares the spongy bone material at each end of a bone to a bridge structure. For strength and resiliency, bones require both organic and inorganic substance, which Dr. Montagna demonstrates with bones lacking one or the other. A diagram shows how the endosteum and the periosteum balance bone growth. X-ray films compare the hands of a three-year-old, which has cartilage at the end of each bone, and a thirty-year-old, which has bone in place.

Dr. Albert Krall, a plant biochemist at the same institute, discusses respiration of plants and reports the two problems his research is trying to solve: how energy is converted into chemical energy and by which enzymatic steps is energy stored. He notes that in 1828 Friedrich Wohler laid the foundation for organic chemistry, and in 1896 Eduard Buchner opened the era of biochemistry. Now the Calvin Group in California has traced the path of carbon through a plant during photosynthesis showing that sunlight acts on the chlorophyll to make organic compounds. Dr. Krall shows a mock-up model of a chloroplast with grana and a hypothetical model representing the enzymatic reaction during photosynthesis. Dr. Bessel Kok, a plant physiologist with the institute, describes a microscopic view of a plant cell. A time lapse film, by Dr. Jan Zurzicky, of chloroplasts under differing light intensities shows an example of light saturation.

Heald, president of the Ford Foundation, explains that the purpose of this foundation's twenty programs is to advance human welfare. Secretary of the Ford Foundation Joseph M. McDaniel points out that foundations can be discriminating, flexible, and can show by example. He describes the Ford Foundation's funding of both the Woodrow Wilson program for attracting able students into the teaching field and the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City. Mr. McDaniel explains that about 400 applications are funded from the 5,000 received annually. These are selected because they seem to provide the best solutions to issues that are within the foundation's purpose and interests. Clarence H. Faust, president of the Fund for the Advancement of Education of the Ford Foundation, describes some of the teacher shortage solutions supported by this fund. For example, this fund contributes to new school construction, and in 1955 it partnered with the Carnegie Foundation to create the National Merit Scholarship Corp. to provide scholarships to send more students to college. Mr. Faust also discusses the ""Hagerstown Project"" in Washington County, MD where a grant from the Ford Foundation has supplied funds for a five-year experiment using closed circuit television for classroom instruction.",Public digital access,Science Review,,Copyright Not Evaluated,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins File 7 on May 3, 1958 from the studios of WJZ in Baltimore, Md.

Likewise, zoologist R.G. Gilmore has discovered that animals crisscrossed the Bering Strait between ice periods. In describing the history of the study of pre-history, Dr. Carter names W.H. Holmes and Ales Hrdlicka as men who led the opposition to the previously generally accepted belief in the existence of a glacial age man in America. With Willard F. Libby's 1951 discovery that all living things contain radioactive carbon, remains could be dated, challenging previous beliefs. From evidence such as stone tools, Dr. Carter speculates that man entered America about 40,000 years ago. He creates a timeline based on the degree of skill in making tools, the degree of weathering on tools, and the date of the existence of the lake where the tools were found. Dr. Carter also discusses physical geography and carbon-14 dating of tools along the southern California coast. Using charts and photos, he shows how reading California river valley records also yields data about sea level, climate, and glaciers.

Professor of physics Theodore Berlin lists future energy issues such as control of thermonuclear fusion reactions, problems with radioactive wastes, application of atomic energy (but not in homes or vehicles), transformation of devices to control energy, and development of solid fuels and solar energy. According to Francis Clauser, professor of aeronautics, in the realm of space travel, commercial airlines will fly at supersonic speeds; guided missiles and anti-missile devices will be the backbone of defense; the U.S. will enjoy peaceful space travel with the Russians; and a rocket will go to the moon. To reinforce this view, Wernher von Braun, in a taped segment, predicts that the U.S. will launch a man into outer space, he will orbit and return to earth. He says an unmanned rocket will also land on Mars. Milton S.

Lynn Poole lists some of the history of the research on brain functions, including that of the early German phrenologist Franz Joseph Gall. In 1817 it was demonstrated that electrical stimulus applied to the brain produced movement on the opposite side of the brain, giving rise to the existence of motor areas of the brain. Using a brain cross-section diagram related to various parts of the body, Dr. Walker shows how the sensory cortex, or homunculus, is closely correlated with the motor cortex. He also discusses what happens when these areas are injured and how they affect vision, hearing, and speech. The association area of the brain is the temporal lobe. Personality and drive may be located in the frontal lobe as lobotomies in that area produce personality change and induce apathy.

This first political protest after the American Revolution was a precursor of Jacksonian democracy and led to the creation of the U.S. Constitution. At issue were the farmers caught between mounting debts and insufficient gold-backed paper currency in circulation. In numerous towns in western Massachusetts, such as Northampton, Worcester, Great Barrington, armed mobs prevented the supreme judicial courts from sitting and sending debtors to prison. They were led by Capt. Daniel Shays, a veteran of the Revolution and farmer from Pelham, MA. Gen. Lincoln's army was sent to suppress the insurrections and protect the judicial courts. On January 25, 1787, Shays' rebels attacked the arsenal at Springfield, MA, but were rebuffed by Gen. Shepard's troops. With the exception of two, the rebels were pardoned after asking forgiveness, and the government made the reforms they sought.

Dr. Kershner shows a film of the missile in action, noting that it doesn't actually hit the target but explodes within close proximity of it. On a mock-up he identifies the payload or warhead and the solid fuel rocket engine with booster rocket. The guidance control system allows ""beam riding"" as the onboard computer corrects the missile's course, and the missile's antennae pick up the intensity of the radar beams' mutations. A transmitter on the ground sends a reference signal to the receiver on the missile, a signature beam that prevents jamming by other radar beams. The electronic information received permits the four hydraulic tail fins to control its flight altitude. Dr. Kershner also explains a model of one of the terrier's control units. The first beam-rider missile was begun in 1947, and its problems were gradually eliminated, as shown in a film shot from a booster section showing ""flutter."" Development of such complex missiles requires not only a team of specialists in many fields but also systems engineers or specialty generalists to produce an integrated final product.

Dance was originally solo and then social. Shawn shows a film of Australian aborigines dancing their stories and film clips of liturgical dance. Dance has long been a form of religious expression and ecstasy. Shawn shows photos and film clips of some of his dances based on religious themes such as the whirling dervish, St. Francis, and Shiva. He discusses turn of the century dance, which used very sterile technical styles. However, Isadora Duncan and Ruth St. Denis initiated the renaissance of dance and the forerunner of modern dance. Film footage shows St. Denis's 1910 ""Incense"" and Shawn and St. Denis in ""Tillers of the Soil.""

Dr. William Avery, of Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Lab, describes how techniques of flight have changed from the Chinese rocket of 1232 AD to the ramjet. Isaac Newton's equal and opposite principle was the basis for jet propulsion, and its first use was in jet-assisted takeoffs, which allowed shorter runways.

He notes that liquid fuel rockets are more subject to failure than solid fuel ones. Dr. Avery briefly describes the work of rocket pioneers Tsiolkovskiy, Goddard, and Oberth. Further research in the field resulted in the air-breathing engine during World War II, pulse jet engine (loud and limited in speed), turbojet engine by Briton Frank Whittle, and ramjet engine, first proposed by Rene Lorin in 1910 but requiring supersonic speed. Dr. Avery describes the key components of the ramjet: the diffuser, fuel system, and combustor. He then explains graphs comparing the ramjet and turbojet in four areas of performance and limitations: thrust per unit frontal area, specific fuel impulse, thrust per unit weight, and speed and altitude limits, proving ramjet the more economical to use.

In 1932, Karl Jansky, from Bell Labs, discovered radio noise from space. Five years later Grote Reber built the first antenna for astronomical observations. The sun was discovered to be a source of radiation and radio waves, as were the Milky Way and Crab Nebula. Later J. G. Bolton and J. G. Stanley discovered a variable source of cosmic radio frequency radiation in the constellation Cygnus. That plus Cassiopeia are the most intense radio sources in the heavens. Additional research resulted in Martin Ryle's development of interferometric techniques, A. E. Lilly's observation of the spiral structure of the universe, and J. H. Oort's mapping of our own galaxy. In 1944, H. Van de Hulst predicted that a hydrogen cloud produces radiation in the radio range of 21cm wavelength. E. Purcell and H. Ewen confirmed this theory, detecting a 21cm cosmic gas emission from neutral hydrogen in the Milky Way in 1951. Ohio University's John Kraus was instrumental in detecting the Milky Way's radio transmissions. In 1955, the Mills Cross Array, a simple radio antenna built by Australian B. Mills, was used to record the radio noise produced by the planet Jupiter. The antenna most commonly used is the paraboloidal reflector with a diameter of 80-90 ft. The largest steerable radio reflector is at Jodrell Bank in the UK. Plans for the National Radio Astronomical Observatory at Green Bank, West Virginia are underway at the time of this program. Increasing research will help to explain whether the explosion theory or the continuous creation theory of the universe is more valid.",Public digital access,Science Review,,Copyright Not Evaluated,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins File 7 on January 18, 1958 from the studios of WAAM in Baltimore, Md.

When Mr. Poole asks if there are any humanistic problems whose solution would affect the lives of many people, Dr. Boas lists standardized textbooks in education, the trend towards authoritarianism, and the elimination of provincialism. He notes that there is no one right answer in the humanities; every person is his own interpreter.

Dr. Robert Huntoon points out that the earth's rotation varies, so to determine the exact time, the NBS uses quartz crystals, or for more accuracy, ammonium atom vibration or a cesium clock operating on the forces within the cesium atom.

Dr. Gus W. Van Beek, Johns Hopkins University archaeologist, says that of written and unwritten remains, archaeology is the only source of information on civilizations before the third millennium B.C., and pottery shreds are the most common remains. On a diagram of the Hajar bin Humeid mound excavated in 1950-51, he shows how each stratum is delineated by debris and specific features. The study of these layers is called stratigraphy. Since ancient pottery styles changed readily, relative chronology of a culture can be based on these changes. For example, the ledge handles on Palestinian jars went through four stages of design change. Likewise, immigration and colonization are revealed by changes in native pottery.

Lynn Poole briefly discusses Freud's early work with Joseph Breuer, who used hypnosis to treat patients with hysteria. This led to Freud's version of psychoanalysis. He believed that the human personality was composed of the conscious and unconscious mind and that impressions in childhood, predominantly sexual, which the conscious mind refused to accept became neuroses in the unconscious mind. Freud's publications affected all disciplines, as evidenced in the reading of a stream of consciousness passage from James Joyce's ""Ulysses."" The impact was similar in art works such as Salvador Dali's ""Persistence of Memory"" and Yves Tanguy's ""Mama, Papa is Wounded!""

He then gives the history of Mars from Francesco Fontana's 1636 drawing of the planet to Christian Huygens' comments on possible inhabitants of Mars and Giovanni Schiaparelli's 1877 observation of Mars's channels (mistakenly translated as ""canals"" by others). Mr. Neathery describes a diagram of the planet's orbit between 1956-71 indicating its nearness to the earth every 15 years. Aerology, or the study of the features of Mars, is done with telescope, spectroscope, thermocouple, and camera and reveals polar caps that wax and wane and a reddish color, thought to be desert, covering 75% of the planet's surface. Dr. Neathery shows a cactus in a bell jar containing nitrogen, argon, carbon dioxide, and oxygen in proportions considered similar to those in the Martian atmosphere and compares it to a cactus plant outside the jar. He also uses balloons filled with nitrogen or helium to demonstrate the escape velocity of gravity on earth as compared to the lower surface gravity on Mars. Because oxygen is nearly non-existent on Mars, the temperatures are extreme, and it's unclear whether chlorophyll exists on the planet, Dr. Neathery concludes that Mars is inhospitable to life as we know it. However, he is certain that man's curiosity will take him there. The trip will take eight months, and an artist's rendition shows what will be seen upon landing.

Clarence Rice, aviation products manager of the Bendix Radio Division in Baltimore, MD, points out that aviation navigation depends on knowing the ground speed and the path of the aircraft over the earth. He uses a chart to demonstrate the effects of winds on plane direction and the efforts to compensate: a homing device, which did not account for wind drift and also picked up static interference; the radio range system, which used four beams to overcome the drift problem but still received static; and the manual direction finder, which became the standard aid in the 1930s. A film describes how, in 1939, Bendix developed the automatic direction finder (ADF) with omnirange, which also eliminated static. Over the ocean, LORAN, or long range navigation, devices were used. Another animated film shows how Christian Doppler, in 1842, described the Doppler effect based on sound waves and how that principle has been applied to radar's radio waves. The film explains the ""plus"" Doppler effect for direct measurement of forward speeds and the ""minus"" for measurement of drift angle. Pitch and roll are also corrected by the radar beams since beam compensation is based on the magnitude of the Doppler shift.

Dr. Hart states that the three artistic entities of music are the composer, the orchestra, and the conductor. The composer invents the music, which is made up of rhythm, melody, and harmony. He demonstrates each of these elements with the tune ""Pop Goes the Weasel,"" which he also plays in the styles of Mozart, Bach, Mendelssohn, Debussy, and Prokofiev. Baltimore composer Sidney Shapiro wrote these variations for this broadcast. Next Dr. Hart describes the history of the orchestra and how instruments were added. He shows a chart of the orchestra seating for a 90-member symphony and explains how the sounds are balanced. Lastly, Dr. Hart explains how the conductor and his baton evolved from the church's choirmaster keeping time with his staff. He displays one page of a full orchestra score and explains each line written for different instruments. The conductor has many tasks, including controlling the orchestra's balance and timing, setting the pace, and unifying the whole, but most of all he must inspire the musicians.",Public digital access,Science Review,,Copyright Not Evaluated,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins File 7 on November 8, 1959 from the studios of WJZ in Baltimore, Md.

He gives the planet's distance from sun and earth, its solar orbiting time, its measurements, and its mass, density, and surface gravity and then announces, ""That's all we know."" A brief history of the astronomers who made telescopic observations and early drawings of Venus include Galileo in 1609, Francesco Fontana in 1645, Gian Domenico Cassini in 1666, Francesco Bianchini, William Herschel, and Johann Schroter in 1788. Mr. Streeter says that Venus apparently has an atmosphere because it reflects sunlight and thus must be covered by dense white clouds. Venus's atmosphere was first thought to be like that of the carboniferous period on earth, but a subsequent spectroscopic study showed nothing but carbon dioxide, permitting no life as we know it. However, the Venusian ocean may support one-celled animals. Mr. Streeter describes the history of speculated life on Venus and shows early sketches of Venusians. Film clips show the 1959 balloon and gondola designed by Johns Hopkins University's Dr. John Strong and piloted by Navy commander Malcolm Ross. It rose to an altitude of 80,000, and its spectroscopic data, analyzed by physicist Charles Moore, showed measurable water vapor on Venus.

M. Levitt, Director of the Fels Planetarium of Philadelphia's Franklin Institute, describes the shape, characteristics, and historical formation of the moon. He explains that over 30,000 craters have been counted on the moon, including Tycho, and that the dark areas called ""seas"" by Galileo are actually deserts. Dr. Levitt predicts that because of its low gravity and lack of atmosphere the moon will be used as a launching site for exploring the solar system. For the same reasons, the moon is also an ideal place for asthmatics and heart sufferers. He discusses the Saturn rocket project under Wernher von Braun, which will launch a rocket to the moon. He anticipates that between 1962-68 a man will land on the moon, but first robots must probe the lunar surface and gather data such as temperature. A man models a Navy full pressure suit similar to what astronauts will use in their lunar exploration. Dr. Levitt also predicts that within the next 20 years a nearly self-sustaining colony will be established on the moon. Displaying a lunar housing simulation model, Dr. Levitt describes how fuel, water, atmosphere, and quarters can be made from readily available basic elements on the moon and how algae and hydroponics could form the basis of the food supply. He maintains that the moon is the key to the conquest of space because the earth's gravity is so strong it limits our exploratory distance.

Andrews demonstrates that all matter vibrates in harmonic wave patterns. He begins by using an oscilloscope and slow motion camera to show a plucked harp string's fundamental vibration at 64 times per second and its harmonics at a faster vibration. He compares this with the two-dimensional vibration of a drum membrane, also viewed on the slow motion camera and oscilloscope. Dr. Andrews then progresses to the three-dimensional wavelength of a sphere and notes that different and more complex harmonic patterns are based on the shape of the object. Since no two statues are alike, their wave patterns are all unique, as evidenced when a gadget taps them repetitively and their sound is recorded on magnetic tape. Dr. Andrews slows the tape to hear specific sounds and compares this to slowing a LP record on a record player from high speed to the proper speed to make the words recognizable. He explains that the aggregate vibration of the whole statue is based on its external shape, like atomic and molecular vibration. He points out that the formula for entropy, the measurement of the complexity of harmonic pattern, is the same as the formula for information theory, the measurement of the amount of information in a communication. Thus, a statue has high information value because its complex external shape gives it a high shape entropy and it communicates more meaning. This concept has implications for the communication values of modern v. classical art.",Public digital access,Science Review,,Copyright Not Evaluated,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins File 7 on March 22, 1959 from the studios of WJZ in Baltimore, Md.

In the seventh century BC, the Phoenicians circumnavigated Africa and may have sailed to the Azores and Canary Islands. They were followed by the Celts, who journeyed to Iceland and Greenland according to accounts by St. Brendan, who set sail from Ireland between 565-573 and encountered a crystal column in the sea, either an iceberg or glacier. He also possibly sailed to the Azores and Canaries and possibly to Mexico since Cortez discovered, in 1519, that the Aztecs celebrated a blend of paganism and Christianity and spoke of Quetzalcoatl, a legendary white priest. The Vikings or Norse also migrated to Iceland in 874. Around 900 they discovered Vitramannaland, or ""white man's land,"" possibly an Irish settlement in North America. In 930 Gunnbjorn discovered Greenland, and in 982 Erik the Red colonized it. Bjarni Herjulfsson, blown off course, explored part of the American coast unknowingly in 985. Leif Erikson also sailed along the shores of the American continent and established a colony named Vinland the Good, its exact location disputed. Other evidence of pre-Columbian Viking discovery includes maps and the existence of the stone Newport Tower in Rhode Island. Edmund Plowden referred to the tower in a 1632 petition, but this may have been elsewhere than Newport. Additional exploration included that of Giovanni da Verrazzano in 1524, the Venetian expedition in 1398 described in ""The Zeno Narrative"", and the Portuguese discovery of Newfoundland in 1450 and Labrador in 1492.",Public digital access,Science Review,,Copyright Not Evaluated,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins File 7 on April 26, 1959 from the studios of WJZ in Baltimore, Md.

He also explains how primitive man reckoned time, the Babylonian astrologers' influence, and the origins of sennight and fortnight. Words for the days of the week in French, Italian, and Anglo-Saxon reflect their origins in the Romans' naming of days for the moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, and the sun.

Mr. Poole displays an American Indian lunar calendar drawn on buckskin for the period 1865-1892.

Eisenhower introduces this program about the Fund for Adult Education, an independent philanthropic organization sponsored by the Ford Foundation to extend liberal education to adults. He explains that as a society becomes more complex, its need for good leaders increases. Charles H. Percy, president of the Bell and Howell Co. and chairman of the board for the Fund, describes leadership in the United States and public responsibility of its citizens. He points out that particularly because we now have the power to destroy ourselves, the future of society depends on the effectiveness of key people in organizations' leadership roles. The president of the Fund, C. Scott Fletcher, says that leadership comes from a multiple, fluid society, offering a constant supply of fresh people with new ideas. A short film shows how uneducated leaders in a village are unable to meet the challenge of change and take a long-range view. Harry A. Bullis, director of the Fund, explains that leadership training is available to Armed Forces staff and at most private organizations, but top government employees only receive on the job training via trial and error, often at the public's expense. The Fund intends to prepare such individuals for public responsibilities. President of Vassar College and vice-chair of the Fund's board Sarah Gibson Blanding describes leadership in Thomas Jefferson's days and how it developed as society became more complex. While there are opportunities for many types of training, adult leadership training is lacking. She reiterates that continuing liberal adult education is necessary. Leaders must be educated to be dedicated, courageous, and imaginative. Mr. Percy concludes that the threat of Soviet Russia and its success with communism will exist for a long time, so we must educate our leaders as efficiently as they do theirs.

Carl Jensen, a lighting engineer and marketing manager, and Dr. John McNall, the director of research at Westinghouse Electric Corp., discuss how this light is generated by exciting phosphors in alternating electric fields and demonstrate the concept using a tilting board with traps and marbles. Electro-luminescence was first discovered in 1936 by Georges Destriau, shown in a film clip. The guests also make the analogy of keys on a piano to the full electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to gamma waves. They explain that lumens are units of light and watts are units of power, and they compare the brightness of electro-luminescence to incandescent and fluorescent bulbs. The new product can become brighter by increasing the voltage or frequency or both, but it has limits. Dr. McNall shows the electrical conductors and other layers making up this artificial source of light and notes that it can be made into many shapes or designs and installed in ceilings, walls, stairs, furniture, and even drapery. However, square panels are the most common shape, as shown in the top of a coffee table and on the walls of a model room. Scientific use of electro-luminescence includes astronautical instrumentation, and electro-enhancement will lead to less x-ray exposure by intensification of fluoroscopy screens. Mr. Jensen predicts that in the future this product could be used for a thin, flat, wall-mounted television screen with controls available remotely for the viewer's convenience.",Public digital access,Science Review,,Copyright Not Evaluated,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins File 7 on May 24, 1959 from the studios of WJZ in Baltimore, Md.

Dr. Lawrence Ross, associate professor of English at the Johns Hopkins University, argues that such modern trappings distort Shakespeare's work and Elizabethan times. He explains that the Shakespeare stage was an open air platform with emphasis on the actors and their speech and symbolized the order of the universe with man in the center. The same scene is then performed on the Folger Shakespeare Library's stage in Washington, DC in period costume. Dr. Ross says that Shakespeare's dramatic poetry spoken on the symbolic stage represented the essence of life and that the meanings of Elizabethan words often differed from current ones. Shakespeare's characters are hybrid: part real, part symbol, such as Shylock exacting a pound of flesh in the dramatized scene from ""The Merchant of Venice."" Dr. Ross analyzes a portrait of Queen Elizabeth as an introduction to the Elizabethan order of natural authority: the king ruled over the state, God over the universe, the sun over the planets, the husband over the family, and reason over man. Actors from Johns Hopkins Play Shop perform five passages from ""Macbeth"" as Dr. Ross explains the violation of the social, political, and natural worlds, evident in the words and their rhythms, when Macbeth and his wife contemplate and carry out the death of King Duncan.",Public digital access,Science Review,,Copyright Not Evaluated,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins File 7 on June 7, 1959 from the studios of WJZ in Baltimore, Md.

Dr. Sigmund Fritz, a meteorologist with the U.S. Weather Bureau, lists the advantages of a satellite in weather forecasting, including its high vantage point, rapid mobility, and broad coverage over the globe. Dr. William Kellogg, a meteorologist with the Rand Corp., describes the typical orbits of satellites launched from Cape Canaveral, explaining why an elliptical orbit is generally preferable, but a circular one is best for a weather satellite. He also says that the higher the satellite's elevation, the longer it will take to circle the earth but the longer the satellite's lifespan as well. Dr. Fritz stresses the technological problems that need to be overcome before satellites can become more useful tools: stabilization, to make it constantly look down; transmission, interpretation, and distribution of collected data; and measurement of cloud reflectivity. The satellites' benefits to meteorology will include wide range cloud detection, measurement of the heat balances that drive the storms, and measurement of radiation balance over land and water by latitude.

Examples of elephant drawings made between 1500 B.C. and 500 A.D. in such diverse places as England, Ceylon, China, and Siam are often stylized or abstract whether the animal is native to the country or not. Similarly, a Greek coin displays an elephant likeness. However, during this period in Central America, Mayan statues, carvings, and writings and Aztec art and rituals distinctly show elephants even though there were none to copy nor anyone to describe them. Thus Dr. Carter maintains that Asian peoples must have brought drawings or statues of elephants to Central America over 2,000 years ago. The proof he offers for this theory is the Thor Heyerdahl transpacific raft voyage (proving such a trip could be made in a primitive vessel), identical temples 12,000 miles apart in Mexico and Cambodia, identical Sumatran and Mexican folding bark religious books, identical fishhooks from Easter Island and California, physical attributes of Central American and Asian Indians (photos show one of each, both playing nose flutes), and plants appearing in lands too far from original sources to have blown there.

He first describes, and displays, sculptures as artistic expressions existing in the round and being representational, semi-representational, or non-representational. He then argues that to understand the purpose of a sculpture, one must consider the culture that produced it and will generally find that it is either humanistic (making a statement about the human condition) or cult (serving as a bridge from this world to the next). As examples of cult objects, Mr. Myers exhibits the bronze head of the dead king of the kingdom of Benin in Nigeria. He also shows an Egyptian rose quartz sculpture of a pharaoh, an 8th century Indian temple corner graced by two dancers, a 14th century French Madonna and child, a second century Gandharan stucco head in the Roman tradition, and a 5th century sculpture similar to a Roman sarcophagus. To contrast humanistic examples of sculpture, Mr. Myers displays the remainder of a Greek Venus sculpture, the ideal of feminine beauty. The neo-humanism of Dante's era led to contemporary individualism as expressed in Maillol's 1898 ""Bather Fixing Her Hair,"" Degas' ""Little Dancer,"" and Matisse's ""Serf,"" ""Reclining Nude,"" and ""Serpentine."" He compares Renoir's 1916 bronze Venus to the ancient one and Henry Moore's abstract ""Reclining Woman"" with previous examples. Mr. Myers maintains that modern artists are the prophets and moralists of society and their return to abstract ideas and figures are a balance of otherworldliness and worldliness, with Venus and the dead king coalescing. He concludes the program showing two abstract metal sculptures: Giacometti's ""Man Pointing"" and Ibram Lassaw's ""Planets.""",Public digital access,Science Review,,Copyright Not Evaluated,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins File 7 on April 3, 1960 from the studios of WJZ in Baltimore, Md.

Geyer and Dr. Charles E. Renn, professors of sanitary engineering at the Johns Hopkins University, discuss the municipal and industrial demands on water. Dr. Geyer explains how a city water meter works and shows the resulting graphs that predict the time of greatest water use. Dr. Renn displays examples of common products and tells how much water is required to manufacture each. He also discusses rainwater, wells, rivers, lakes, and reservoirs as sources of water and how river water can be used, treated, and returned. A film clip documents the formation of a river. Using a diagram, Dr. Geyer explains municipal water purification and waste treatment processes. Dr. Renn discusses industrial waste disposal and how it can cause stream pollution unless treated by a waste control plant, such as that of American Cyanamid Co., in New Jersey. Dr. Geyer notes the growing conflict in the American southwest over water use between industry and agriculture. Dr. Renn concludes that increasing water demands require either stopping growth or building more dams and evaluating priorities for use, such as recent multiple use (recreation, power, water control) projects of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA).",Public digital access,Science Review,One hundred gallons a day,Copyright Not Evaluated,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins File 7 on November 29, 1959 from the studios of WJZ in Baltimore, Md.

In one greenhouse two groups of plants are receiving the same daytime conditions, but at night one is kept in total darkness while the other receives eight additional hours of incandescent light. Two four-year old loblolly pines show the results of this experiment. Dr. H. A. Borthwick explains that this is to study photoperiodism, or the effect of light on the plants' growth mechanism. In 1918 Wightman W. Garner and Harry A. Allard discovered that it is not the length of the day but rather of the night that is the determining factor in flower and seed production and growth of plants. Further experiments with lettuce, bean, tomato, and corn seeds test the effect of spectrum light colors and exposure on germination. A far red light creates a taller plant, and red light creates the tomato skin color. The mechanism in a plant the reacts to light is not chlorophyll but rather a two-way growth pigment, phytochrome, that acts as a switch with red and far red light. A film shows the process, using a spectrophotometer, by which this was determined. K. H. Norris demonstrates a spectrophotometer with a corn sample and explains the results with graphs. Two film clips show Sterling B.

Mencken, opens this show on the ""Sage of Baltimore,"" and quotes him throughout the program. Lynn Poole gives a pictorial account of Mencken's early life. Dr. Carl Bode, University of Maryland English professor, discusses Mencken as a critic of literature, society, and politics. He points out Mencken's contentiousness in his writing, especially in political criticism, such as his comments in 1912 on Baltimore mayor James H. Preston. Although Mencken stood up for New Realists such as Dreiser and Hemingway, he disliked the pretentiousness of many authors of his day and spoke out against bestsellers with no literary merit. With Mr. Potter's assistance, Dr. Bode describes events in Mencken's career as editor and columnist with ""The Baltimore Sun"" newspaper, co-editor with George Jean Nathan of ""The Smart Set,"" editor and writer for ""The American Mercury,"" and author of numerous books, such as ""George Bernard Shaw"" and ""The American Language."" Mr. Potter dramatizes a portion of Mencken's obituary for William Jennings Bryan, written after Bryan's death following the 1925 Scopes Trial. In 1926 the Watch and Ward Society of Boston forced off the newsstands Mencken's controversial ""Hatrack"" story in ""The American Mercury,"" but Mencken prevailed. However, his unchanging views became trivial when he failed to recognize and understand the grave implications of the Great Depression or Hitler. Johns Hopkins professor emeritus Kemp Malone discusses Mencken's book ""The American Language,"" which posits that American English was so different from British English that it should have a separate name.

Dr. Sanford Rosenthal, pharmacologist at the National Institute of Arthritis and Metabolic Diseases in Bethesda, MD, explains the emergency treatment he developed that is recommended in the dramatic scene: one teaspoon of salt plus half teaspoon of baking soda mixed in one quart of cool water and delivered orally to the burn victim at the rate of one quart per twenty pounds of body weight during the first 24 hours and half the amount during the next 24 hours. He explains that since 1942 National Institute of Health (NIH) has studied shock that follows severe injuries such as burns, crushing injuries, and hemorrhage. A film shows the procedure that replicated these types of injuries on female albino mice. Tissue fluid and blood rushing to the wound area result in dehydration, sodium deficiency, and reduced blood volume overall and can be corrected by administering Rosenthal's fluid treatment orally or intravenously. Dr. Kehl Markley, also of NIH, explains a chart comparing the amount of saline treatment to survival rate. He then narrates a film about 1951 experiments with human burn victims in Lima, Peru, where half received saline solution by mouth and half received plasma and glucose by vein. The two groups showed no significant differences after 24 hours, although many burn victims who survive the shock later die from infection.

In it, Dr. George Carter, geography professor at Hopkins, notes that Louis S.B. Leakey found evidence of the earliest primitive man and his tools in Kenya. He then displays revised maps of the world that reveal different land masses during glacial periods, thus allowing the Kenyan man to explore new lands and form colonies over a period of 100,000 years until the glaciers receded and the oceans returned. Dr. Carter discusses the transformation of Kenyan man from an isolated pygmy into modern man with regional or racial characteristics, such as the cave dwelling ""Sinanthropus pekinesis"" in northern China and the Swanscombe man in England. Glacial periods also created a land bridge near the Bering Strait, allowing animals and man to cross from Asia into North America. Tools found in the Americas plus the physical characteristics of early American Indians offer proof of waves of Asian migrations. Survivors of early man include the australoids, europids, and mongoloids. At the conclusion of the program, host Lynn Poole thanks members of the studio, university, and network for their hard work and dedication.

A map shows their route from Independence, Missouri to Oregon. Miller's sketches, later transformed into over 200 watercolors (now preserved in the Walters Art Gallery and displayed on this program) and oil paintings, chronicle such events as buffalo hunts, prairie fires, and river crossings, as well as such landmarks as Chimney Rock, Scott's Bluff, Fort Laramie, Independence Rock, and The Devil's Gate. Miller's paintings also show encounters with Sioux tribes and Black Feet Indians, various tribal members, and Indian women.

To meet military demands for preserved foods during war, Nicholas Appert devised a method of preserving foods by heating them in sealed containers to destroy the bacteria. In 1812 Peter Durand invented the tin can and the first canning factory opened in Great Britain. A dramatization describes a typical 1815 dinner consisting predominantly of pickled, salted, smoked, and dried foods. Thomas Kensett patented Durand's tin cans in the U.S. in 1825. During the Civil War demands for canned foods increased, boosting mass production of the tin cans. Other products began appearing in cans, such as I. W. Lyons' tooth powder for home use; Gerhard Mennen's talcum powder for babies, in a lithographed can with a sprinkle top; and Gilbert Van Camp's pork and beans combination. A selection of 1880s mass produced, decorative tins display a variety of products, many non-perishable. Soldering the tops of cans by hand gave way to open-topped cans that could be seamed shut by machine. The only exception to this were condensed or evaporated milk cans, patented in 1856 by Gail Borden. A film shows a canning factory, producing 30,000 cans per hour, from cutting the tin plate to testing and shipping the final products.

Connolly outlines Project Transit, the first operational navigation satellite system for the use of submarines and surface vessels. He gives credit for this idea to Dr. William Guier and Dr. George Weiffenbach, of the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab (APL), who realized that after the launch of Russian Sputnik I they could track its position by observing the Sputnik's Doppler shift. Frank McClure, heard of research at APL, visualized that the opposite would then be true: a satellite in orbit could determine a point of reference on earth. Dr. Richard Kershner, former head of the Terrier surface to air missile program at APL, headed the designing and building of the Transit satellite. Dr. Kershner explains why the Doppler technique is highly accurate, and an animated segment simplifies this phenomenon. Using a chart and a mock up, Dr. Kershner describes the construction and sections of Transit I and how it functions, including its solar cells, radiation shield, and telemetering system. Film clips taken at APL show testing of weights on the satellite as well as the shake test, centrifuge test, and heat/cold tests. Additional film clips show the tracking stations, to monitor the satellite's received signals, in Maryland, New Mexico, and Texas, plus two mobile vans stationed in Washington and Newfoundland. Rear Admiral Connolly discusses the future of this project as it adds more satellites and notes that this television program is the first to reveal Project Transit, ""the practical navigational system of the future."" Host Lynn Poole concludes this twelfth anniversary program by pointing out that it is the oldest program on network television. He reminisces about the four stations on the network (Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York) when the first program premiered on March 9, 1948. Poole also shows clips from ""Fear,"" the oldest program kinescoped (October 3, 1950), the 1952 three-part series on outer space featuring Heinz Haber and Wernher Von Braun, and APL's Dr. Ralph E. Gibson's orbital shots of ""The World from 70 Miles Up"" (December 17, 1948).

The Bay is 200 miles long, 20 miles wide, and a great natural resource for commercial and recreational users. Dr. Donald Pritchard, director of the Institute, shows viewers such below deck equipment as the pyrheliometer, which measures and records the intensity of solar radiation; and thetri-filter hydrophotometer, which measures the amount of red, green, and blue light that penetrates the various depths of the Bay and indicates the amount of energy in the water available for underwater plant growth. Using a schematic illustration, Dr. Carritt describes the environmental factors affecting plants and organisms in the Bay, such as water currents, temperature, and salinity as well as availability of plant food, oxygen, and animal life. Dick Whaley demonstrates a microscope mounted with a camera to study and record species of organisms such as diatoms. Other instruments read the salinity and temperature of the water, measure the angle of the current, and analyze the amount of dissolved oxygen in water for plant use.

Andrews and funded by Mrs. William Hale Harkness. Dr. Andrews hypothesizes that all matter is music since all matter in the universe vibrates, and tones and harmonies are made by vibrations. The motion of a plucked violin string and its adjacent string (sympathetic resonance) are shown in slow motion and on an oscilloscope. Dr. Andrews discusses one dimensional harmony, as described by Pythagoras. Two dimensional harmonies are indicated by the fractional overtones of a drum head membrane, which is shown in slow motion and heard electronically enhanced. Three dimensional harmonies result from the contraction and expansion of a sphere; however, differently shaped solids, such as statues, have fractional resonances that produce unique chords or harmonic patterns when vibrating. Four dimensional harmonies come from atom vibration, a wave whose harmonic pattern is displayed by a vibrating sphere. Thus, Dr. Andrews concludes that since an atom is not a particle that vibrates in space, but rather the vibration itself, all matter is in dynamic form or all matter is music. He continues by playing on a piano the chords of tones of atoms produced by different chemical compounds. He also shows and discusses the pattern of Bach's music on an oscilloscope and music composed by Rebekah West Harkness.

After Lynn Poole explains x-rays' discovery by William Roentgen (1895), their definition, and their use, Dr. Russell Morgan interviews three scientists from the conference. Dr. E.S. Gurdjian, a Wayne State University radiologist, describes types of automobile accidents and shows how x-rays can demonstrate the severity of skull fractures at different speeds. Dr. Wallace Tirman, of Caylor Nichol Institute in Bluffton, Indiana, demonstrates a technique for using fine-grain film to make x-rays viewable under a microscope. These microradiographs show thin slices of body tissue for analysis on a diffraction x-ray unit. Dr. Jeffrey P. Moore, of Temple University Hospital in Philadelphia, shows that inserting a needle into a patient's back and injecting an opaque material is a more direct method for x-raying the spinal column to diagnose cartilage problems.",Public digital access,Science Review,,Copyright Not Evaluated,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins science review on September 25, 1951 from the studios of WAAM in Baltimore, Md.

The result is generally the average of a 100-fly test. Dr. Dethier then shows how one can predict the feasibility of some chemical compounds as repellents by their composition.

Dr. Franco Rasetti recreates one experiment from the first show, which was filmed in a Johns Hopkins classroom: the spontaneous break-up of a radioactive element as evidenced by a Geiger counter's response. Dr. Ralph Witt, of the plastics lab, shows how plastics are made and molded by replicating the same plastic resin he made on the program five years ago. He explains how glass fibers can now be woven into fabric and covered with plastic resin to make a strong laminate. Lynn Poole then pages through album photos to recall other programs: John Lehman, the university glassblower; Dr. Donald H. Andrews freezing the atom; medical artists; warnings on sunburn; ""Fear,"" the first program (10/3/50) for the Dumont Network; Dr. Russell Morgan unveiling the x-ray fluoroscope; human engineering; Dr. Arthur Parpart demonstrating the new microscope combined with a television screen; films of the earth taken by a camera 70,000 feet above the earth.

Lynn Poole opens the program by paying special tribute to Elmer V. McCollum, who discovered vitamins A and B, and John Lee Pratt, who donated money to establish the McCollum Pratt Institute of the University. Using a periodic table, Dr. McElroy points out the macronutrients (nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, magnesium, sulfur, calcium, and sodium) and the micronutrients or trace elements (copper, manganese, iron, and zinc). In addition to these, animals need cobalt and iodine to thrive and plants need boron and molybdenum. Both a diagram and an animation show how a nutrient deficiency in the soil may not affect plant health but won't be passed on to humans or animals and therefore could adversely affect them (e.g., lack of iodine in the soil may result in goiter in a human).",Public digital access,Science Review,,Copyright Not Evaluated,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins science review on February 23, 1953 from the studios of WAAM in Baltimore, Md.

The 75,000 precise ridges must be so accurately spaced that it requires a special machine to make a diffraction grating. Dr. Henry H. Rowland developed the first one in 1860, but Dr. John Strong refined this machine, the ruling engine, in 1950. Using a model of the machine, Dr. Strong explains the operation of a ruling engine, focusing on the perfect twin screws that are its vital parts. The maker of these screws, David Broadhead, of Wellsville, NY, demonstrates how one cuts one of these screws on a machine lathe. In a film, Wilbur Perry, one of the most accomplished mechanical and optical technicians in making diffraction gratings, constructs parts of the ruling engine, including the diamond used to cut the 75,000 grooves on the aluminum-coated glass.

As an example of one way to measure the extent of the fear response, Dr. Shaw shows a film of Dr. Charles Eriksen throwing a live snake at a woman to record her galvanic skin response and heart rate. Dr. Eriksen later demonstrates that familiarity and experience can be used to overcome a fear. Dr. Shaw describes the difference between fear and caution and explains that fears are more likely to become pathological than other emotions. Phobias are irrational fears associated with specific objects, usually associated with an intense or unusual experience in childhood. Examples of typical phobias include acrophobia, claustrophobia, xylophobia, dromophobia, agoraphobia, monophobia, zoophobia, ailurophobia, topophobia, and myctophobia. In an experiment to learn if a person could be conditioned to fear, J. B.

He describes the location of Mars and compares its relative size and distance from other planets using a football field model and the length of an imaginary plane flight. Telescopic views of Mars are unclear and photographs are difficult to make; however, polar caps have been seen and their changing size suggests seasons on the planet. The Dutch astronomer Christian Huyghens sketched Mars with continents and oceans, but his view has been disproved.

He notes that ""Portland"" is not a trade name for cement but rather a standard cement powder formula named by an English bricklayer in 1824 for the isle of Portland. The Romans used concrete, made from Mt. Vesuvius's volcanic rock and sand, to construct many of their famous buildings. Mixing concrete is compared to following a recipe since measurement is critical. Furthermore, the chemistry of concrete is such that it requires moisture for 7-10 days to properly harden. Dr. Boyer enumerates the versatility of concrete and shows how pre-casting concrete of precise forms speeds up construction. He then discusses concrete use in bridge building. Because concrete is strong in compression but relatively weak in tensile strength, reinforced concrete with embedded steel was developed in 1850, and pre-stressed concrete, held in a permanent squeeze with steel wires and bars, is now used in bridges and many other applications.",Public digital access,Science Review,,Copyright Not Evaluated,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins science review on February 17, 1954 from the studios of WAAM in Baltimore, Md.

In discussing modern plastic surgery, Dr. Edgerton notes that it is not necessarily centered on the face or visible external features.

Latin began as the language of Rome and its vicinity, but through many conquests the Romans spread the use of Latin to the rest of Italy and what is now France, Spain, and North Africa. The Romans also conquered Greece, but since Green was also a highly developed literary language, the Greeks retained their own language. Latin also became the language of the Roman Catholic Church and medieval universities. Many scientific discoveries made during the Renaissance and the early modern period were given names in Latin. Even today Latin names such as Zea mays (corn) are used in scientific communication. Carl von Linné or Carolus Linneaus in Latin classified life forms in an orderly way using Latin terms. In his classification of kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus and species, a dog would be animal, chordata, mammalia, carnivora, canidae, canis familiarus. The Babylonians were fond of the number 60, which is retained today in 60 seconds in a minute, and 60 minutes in an hour, and even 360 degrees in a circle, which is 6 times 60.

A film by the U.S. Dept. of Interior then shows the historical use of the Colorado River. In the late 1800s, Thomas Blythe acquired 40,000 acres in Palo Verde Valley, California and filed the first water rights to the river. In 1867 Jack Swilling built the first irrigation canals in Arizona. By diverting water from the river to land, the southwest began to thrive. However, floods, such as the one that created Salton Sea in 1905, alternating with droughts required a plan to stabilize the flow of the Colorado. Arthur Powell Davis, Director of the U. S. Reclamation Service, proposed a dam, and the Boulder Canyon Project Act was passed in 1928. In 1931 dam construction was begun in Black Canyon, and Hoover Dam (called Boulder Dam from 1933-1946) was completed in 1936, two years ahead of schedule. The resulting Lake Mead, named in honor of U. S. Reclamation Commissioner Dr. Elwood Mead, extends over 100 miles upstream, can hold 2 years of flow from the Colorado River, and has become a very popular recreation area for water sports.",Public digital access,Science Review,,Copyright Not Evaluated,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins science review on August 5, 1954 from the studios of WAAM in Baltimore, Md.

Skin, covering approximately 18 square feet, is a human's largest organ and serves as the body's protection. Using both live animals from the Baltimore Zoo and representations of animals, Dr. Sullivan explains their protective mechanisms: the lizard's skin changes color for camouflage; the duck's preen gland maintains its feathers with a precursor of vitamin D; the rat's sebaceous glands repel lice; the lion's mane protects it from other animals' bites; and a turtle's shell, a porcupine's quills, and a pachyderm's thick skin all protect the animal within. Dr. Sullivan draws a diagram of the layers of human skin, stressing the epidermis and protective barrier that prevents water from penetrating skin. He notes that a frog has no transitional layer, so its skin can take up water. The human sweat glands continuously secrete a wet film on the skin. The sebaceous glands secrete sebum, which contains two emulsifiers that allow the skin to sweat.",Public digital access,Science Review,,Copyright Not Evaluated,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins science review on October 3, 1954 from the studios of WAAM in Baltimore, Md.

He says that of the two major milk cow groups, the European cattle offer high milk production but low resistance to a hot environment and the native Indian humped cattle are the opposite. In addition to breeding the most heat resistant European cows and selecting the native cattle with the highest milk production for breeding, the Dept. of Agriculture is cross breeding Jersey cows and Sindhi cows. The research results seem to show that a cow that is 5/8 native Sindhi has the best combination of heat tolerance and milk production. In a film of the heat room, Mr. McDowell explains experiments which measure the cows' sweat and their respiratory cooling. He also notes that the color and thickness of a cow's coat and its blood flow to the skin are possible determinants in heat adaptation.",Public digital access,Science Review,,Copyright Not Evaluated,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins science review on September 5, 1954 from the studios of WAAM in Baltimore, Md.

Dr. McKusick explains the limitation of stethoscopes to show the need for spectral phonocardiography, a Bell Labs invention which records three-dimensional heart sounds. To create a spectral phonocardiogram, the doctor places a microphone over the patient's chest to record the heart's sounds on magnetic tape, but only the abnormalities are displayed in the final product. An EKG is also made simultaneously for comparison.

Because the parts of the brain affected (cortex, cerebellum, and basal ganglia) do not regenerate, surrounding brain cells must be trained to carry out the missing functions. This is done through physical therapy. Dr. Phelps describes the activities of therapists at the Children's Rehabilitation Institute working with children on reciprocal exercise patterns and training them on the stabilizer, crutches, and parallel bars. Mr. Schwartz works with children on blowing exercises, speech and auditory therapy, and speech training using a mirror. Children demonstrate other exercises including grasping and releasing blocks, placing pegs in holes as part of a game, practicing dressing skills on a doll, and typing on an electric typewriter.

This is the first public showing and demonstration of a combination of x-ray photography and fluoroscopy picked up by a television receiving tube, affording both dynamic and clear internal views of patients. The equipment was constructed at The Johns Hopkins University with funds from the U.S. Public Health Service and developed by Dr. Russell H. Morgan. Dr. Morgan shows and explains the dim images of a standard fluoroscope and the static x-rays of a chest, colon, and kidney produced on a radiographic table to compare the strengths and weaknesses of each procedure. With physicist Ralph Sterm at the controls and assisted by Vernon Bowers, Ed Custer, and Roy Collier, Dr. Morgan then demonstrates his new invention, which amplifies images 300-3,000 times, and x-rays the movement of the chest and hand of Joan Hunter for viewers to see. Finally, in the first live television, inter-city diagnosis, Dr. Paul C. Hodges, at the University of Chicago, and Dr. Waldron Sennott, at the U.S. Marine Hospital in New York, observe the x-ray/fluoroscopy images broadcast on their televisions and consult with Dr. David Gould, at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, and together diagnose and prescribe treatment for a patient, machine operator James Carter, who has metal particles clearly lodged in his chest and possibly his lungs.",Public digital access,Science Review,,Copyright Not Evaluated,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins science review on December 5, 1950 from the studios of WAAM in Baltimore, Md.

Baltimore Polytechnic Institute teacher Malcolm Davies proves that perpetual motion does not exist. The device purporting it is actually a Crookes' radiometer that merely demonstrates the facts of radiation. Davies then discusses the navigational issues confronting Columbus and his sailors, such as the differences in distances from the magnetic poles to the actual poles and the strength of the tradewinds. Poole exhibits a copy of ""The Story of Maps"", written by Peabody librarian Lloyd A. Brown, which mentions an astrolabe, like that used by Columbus. Davies displays an astrolabe and shows how it's used in conjunction with the north star for navigation. He also demonstrates Gunter's quadrant and a marine sextant. The camera views through the sextant eyepiece as Davies makes adjustments, allowing viewers to experience its operation. Finally, using several examples, Davies explains Bernoulli's Principle, which occurs when vehicles at high velocity pass on roads and atmospheric pressure appears to push them together.

Dr. Harry F. Klinefelter, of the Johns Hopkins Hospital, explains charts showing the mechanical, metabolic, degenerative, and psychological complications of obesity as well as the issues of decreased life expectancy, malignant disease (cancer), and cirrhosis of the liver. He points out that the basic problem is overeating, or taking in more calories than the body requires for energy. However, since the basal metabolism and average daily metabolism varies by person, two people of similar build may have quite different food requirements. Dr. Klinefelter compares people to cars of similar size that get different mileage due to variations in their engine construction and design. He displays average height and weight tables, which don't consider body build and bone structure, and thus are merely guidelines. Dr. Eugene Meyer, psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins, discusses the psychological factors in weight reduction. Compulsive eating begins when one habitually seeks comfort and satisfaction through eating, creating the cycle described by Dr. Hilde Bruch. This pattern may also begin by filling a sense of loss or emptiness with food or by mothers habitually consoling a child with food. Dr. Klinefelter explains that for weight reduction fat must be metabolically burned. Massage and strenuous exercise are both ineffectual in doing this. Since losing more than two pounds per week is dangerous, Dr. Klinefelter recommends a long-term balanced diet, limiting high calorie foods such as bread, potatoes, butter, and cereal and eliminating sweets. He also suggests eating three small meals each day, drinking 6-8 glasses of water per day, using the normal amount of salt, eating a well-balanced diet, and weighing only every two weeks on the same scale and the same time of day.",Public digital access,Science Review,,Copyright Not Evaluated,"Broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins science review on July 15, 1953 which was a rebroadcast of the program that was originally aired on September 22, 1952 from the studios of WAAM in Baltimore, Md.

During the rest of the show, he demonstrates a Trippensee planetarium, explains why water funnels in a counter-clockwise spiral in the northern hemisphere, and describes how a monkey wrench dropped into a mine shaft drifts to the east before landing because of the earth's rotation. He then explains how the earth revolves in orbit around the sun, mentioning Frederich Wilhelm Bessel's 1838 theory of stellar positions based on astronomer James Bradley's observations.

A chart compares consumption of raw materials in 1900, 1950, and 1975 and the resulting production surpluses and deficits. Dr. Arnold C. Harberger, Johns Hopkins University economist and staff consultant on the Commission, explains how projections on zinc and steel demands are calculated. He assumes that although the 1975 GNP will be twice that of 1950, demand for many goods, such as automobiles and televisions, won't grow at the same rate. A chart shows the general demands of all natural resources in 1975. Harberger says that to meet these demands, the Commission recommends efficient production of coal and petroleum, geological surveys of the United States, and mass production of such new materials as tantalum and germanium.

Dr. Brownlee Corrin, a professor at Goucher College and alumnus of Stanford University, describes the campus and its electron linear accelerator. Photos show Director Edward Ginzton and the operation of this new atom smasher. Alumnus of the University of California, Dr. Richard McQuaid, tells about the university, and photos show Dr. George H. Hart and his research on cattle grazing. Carl Foster, alumnus of Indiana University, lists some of that university's famous scientists. A film documents the work being done there by Dr. Joseph C. Muhler, Dr. Harry G. Day, and Dr. William H. Nebergall on the effects of fluorides on children's teeth. Baltimore Judge Joseph Kolodny describes Boston University, and photos from that institution show staff of the Physical Research Lab demonstrating an aerial camera, which uses glass spherical negatives. Assistant dean and alumnus of New York University Dr. F. K. Teichman describes that school's programs. To research air pollution, NYU's engineering research division has constructed a smoke tunnel to observe the behavior of plant emissions based on stack speed and wind velocity and a wind tunnel to determine how building design affects smoke flume behavior. Current scientific activities at The Johns Hopkins University include diffraction gratings used in a spectroscope, research on cancer, and trace element studies, all of which will be featured on forthcoming programs.

He shows sketches of other early balances, including the Egyptian first class lever and the Roman steelyard, both still in use today. Other types of scales and the kilogram weight kept by the Bureau of National Standards are shown. Johns Hopkins University chemistry professor Alsoph H. Corwin exhibits the highly precise balance he developed to measure very small samples of rare substances for microchemical manipulations. His assistant, Joseph Walter, demonstrates how magnetism, heat, vibration, and static can interfere with accurate measurements, and Dr. Corwin explains how his balance avoids all of these interferences.

Berenblum, Dr. Richard Te Linde, of the Johns Hopkins Medical School and Hospital, discusses cancer of the cervix. Dr. Te Linde notes that although three-quarters of women afflicted with this cancer die from it, it is curable if treated in its early stages. He answers commonly asked questions about the development of cervical cancer and describes typical symptoms. He cites Dr. Norman Miller's study on how the loss of time in treating cervical cancer can make a difference in curability. Dr. Te Linde draws a uterus, cervix, and vagina and shows how a speculum, biopsy forceps, and a spatula are used to detect early cases. Drs. Trout and Papanicolaou's pap smear test can reveal both normal and malignant cells from the cervix. Dr. Telinde shows several slides of cervical cancer cells in various stages of malignancy and says that at the pre-invasive stage, this cancer can be cured with either surgery (hysterectomy) or irradiation.",Public digital access,Science Review,,Copyright Not Evaluated,"Originally broadcast as a segment of the television program Johns Hopkins science review on January 19, 1953 from the studios of WAAM in Baltimore, Md.

Lynn Poole honors the scientists currently attending the 90th annual meeting of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), presided over by Johns Hopkins University's president, Detlev Bronk. Poole describes highlights in the history of the organization, such as Congress' legalization of use of the metric system in 1866 and creation of the U.S. Forest Service in 1896, both based on recommendations of NAS. In 1916 NAS established the National Research Council, and through the efforts of its first chairman, George Ellery Hale, and Dr. Robert A. Millikan, President Woodrow Wilson requested NAS to perpetuate the Council. The remainder of the program explains and demonstrates misconceptions about scientific facts: a copper penny can not substitute for a burned out fuse; small flies are not offspring of large flies (houseflies, blow flies, and stable flies are all in their adult stages); spontaneous generation of rags into mice or horse hair into worms does not occur; people can not be hypnotized against their will; frozen body parts should not be rubbed with snow; ice does not make anything near it very cold (as an experiment with liquid nitrogen shows); water will not put out any fire (water on potassium will start a fire); oysters are also edible in months not containing ""r""; mentally ill people can be cured; and mothers do not ""mark"" their babies before birth.
